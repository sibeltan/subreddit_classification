Anticonsumption,[META] A discussion about what does and doesn't belong on this subreddit,"I've seen a lot of people talking about how this subreddit is losing focus and becoming low quality, and I sort of agree with them, so I'm going to list out some of the major topics we see on this subreddit and try to classify them.

**Topics that definitely belong here**

-Discussions about the effects of consumerism

-Discussions about human psychology and consumption

-Discussions about marketing and advertising

-Advice for how to consume less

-Discussions about ""ethical consumption"" and its various complexities

**Things that don't always belong here**

-Criticisms of capitalism. On the one hand, it's hard to discuss consumerism without discussing the underlying economic systems. On the other hand, not every anti-capitalist or left wing topic is relevant to anti-consumption. I recently saw a post here that was basically saying that health care is a human right. While I agree, I also don't see how it relates specifically to this subreddit. If you think that these posts *do* relate to the subreddit, then please take the effort to explain your reasoning.

-Memes. I enjoy memes, but I find that subreddits that don't restrict memes will eventually become nothing but memes. I feel like the same thing is starting to happen here. Some subreddits have a ""shitpost friday"", and memes are only allowed on those days. Perhaps we could do something similar here.

-Pictures showing a particularly offensive example of advertising. I mean, on the one hand, it shows how out of control advertising has become these days, but on the other hand, we're all trying to get away from advertising, and I'd rather not come here only to see more advertising.

**Things that definitely do NOT belong here**

-Pictures of excessive packaging. This literally has nothing to do with the topic of consumerism. There are other subreddits for this sort of thing. You could argue that the excessive packaging is the result of something else that's related to over-consumption, but simply posting pictures of packaging is not relevant to this subreddit.

Does anyone else have anything to add?",2019-10-16 11:24:16,2,15
Anticonsumption,Commercial about saving coins?,I remember a commercial from years and years ago in which some kids drop coins on another boy from a window and he keeps picking them up.

Anticonsumption,No New Clothes,"So I'm trying to do no new clothes for a year, with the exception of underwear and socks, stuff that you can't get at a thrift store. I recently had to add a month because I caved and bought a recycled cashmere sweater at Patagonia I apparently couldn't resist, but I'm wondering what tactics people find really work for cutting their consumption.

I make clothes, and mend the clothes I have, hand wash my delicates, and line dry when I can. I have high quality Tupperware and Pyrex that I hope will last, I use the library, especially the Libby app for ebooks, but I'm sure there's stuff I haven't thought of.

As my title says, this documentary centers around the pickers, people who work picking recyclables out of mountains of garbage in the Jardim Gramacho, the largest landfill in the world.

Anticonsumption,"For those who have small kids, consider using a diaper service","I found a local diaper service that for less than $30/week will drop off, pick up, and launder cloth diapers.

They also rent all associated plastic (vinyl diaper covers, durable bag for soiled diapers, durable plastic collection hamper with closing lid). So this household will result in near-zero plastic heading to a landfill.

Similar services are available in most major cities. Also feels good to support local mom and pop shops rather than the big conglomerates P&G or Kimberly Clarke. It's a high labor, low profit business I'm sure, which means the big companies stay far away.",2019-10-14 08:32:42,2,16

There were definitely parts I  liked; watching athletes compete in the games, sheep herding, and trying some scottish food. But besides that it was an entire cash grab. Vendors were set up that had nothing to do with the theme, kid toys were being sold left and right, whole food trucks set up just for fried food. After about twenty minutes I felt like the only thing left to do was consume, so I left. Seeing the mindless consumption bothers me, it felt more like a shopping mall than a place to observe a culture.",2019-10-12 12:56:11,3,34

We’ve switched to reusable bags (to replace ziplocs), reusable cleaning supplies, period cups, etc., to do what I can to get out of this cycle of consumerism and environmental harm. But I find myself buying little things almost compulsively, and ever since it came to my awareness I’m having a hard time stopping! It’s ridiculously difficult for me not to buy random cute things - especially jewelry.

When it comes to clothes and jewelry, how the f do I make it stop?! How did you guys go from consumer to not?? I’m looking for tips on how to reduce my wardrobe yet still be satisfied with it and how to stop myself from impulse buys.

Anticonsumption,Anticonsumption in a college report,"I'll probably delete this realizing it doesn't fit here, especially as there's no pictures of plastic waste porn, but the sub is really vague so here goes. 

I'm a business major. And yeah, I myself am really uncomfortable and wish I just went and studied biology despite being dumb or liberal arts despite being broke. On a class on ethics, the Prof will remind us these won't teach us ethics and actually we'll most likely learn how to be unethical as we will know the rules. Good God, are these classes uncomfortable. How to manipulate employees by holding healthcare hostage, manipulate consumers with pyschology, etc. 

Anyways, got to write a report on something I enjoy thinking about, but is a problem in the current world. Environmentalism and reducing consumption are really vague, so I'm narrowing down to talking about reducing land consumption/sustainable development- I feel really passionately that the experiment in mass producing human society that is suburbanism has failed, and only leads to destruction of happiness, local community and business, and the environment. I feel like writing alternatives to plastics and why they aren't popular yet could also be an interesting topic... Either of these sound interesting, or feel like they could fit in the sub if they come out halfway worth sharing?",2019-10-11 08:42:41,11,5

Obviously not buying anything (or a zero waste product) is ideal but I'll assume most of us still buy goods. What's one way you've cut down what you need to buy?

For example, I've discovered a better way to soap up my body. I now wet my body, swipe a soap bar a few times over a body part. Then put the soap bar down, and rub the soap in as much as I can. This has drastically reduced how fast I go through soap bars, saves me money, plastic, and whatever other energy saved in manufacturing.

Anticonsumption,How to handle an inherited house and the associated items in a frugal and sensible way?," I inherited a house with two households as unfortunately both my Mum and Grandma passed away this year. It's a hard time for me and I am struggeling on what to do with the house as well as the household items. As I was raised in this house, I prefer not to sell it, but will try to rent it. Moving in myself is no option atm, as my job is located about two hours away.

Before I rent the house, I need to clean it out. How can I deal with the items in a frugal way? Any recommendations or experiences from frugal and anticonsumption redditors?

There are so many towels, bed linens, tableware, dish towels, decorations, clothes etc. that would last me a long, long time without having to buy new stuff. But I live in a shared flat and don't have endless space to store everything until I need it in the future. Plus, some of the items are very oldfashioned and I don't like them. But does it matter? They are already there and I could save a lot of money if I use them.

I am wondering if I should remodel one of the cellar rooms to store things until I need them? Paying money for renting additional storage space doesn't make sense imho.

Thanks for reading, I am looking forward for some advice.",2019-10-05 07:32:15,8,13

Anticonsumption,I'm trying to consume consciously but with a twist,"Last year I started to go zero waste, but I didn't want to share my journey by simply asking others to just do it for the environment. Like what is the point? How long do you do it for until the environment ""gets better"" and how do you easily measure your effort? How do you stay motivated also?

So my idea was to create a podcast where I encourage others to buy less, buy wisely, consider more but only if they save money and again with the outcome being environmentally friendly through zero waste. That means you don't have to think about the environment as the primary focus of such a life change. It's not as scary as some people think, and if a person can make money from nothing, then what's the downside? So what you're doing instead is thinking about your wallet and watching how you end up with more money at the end of a given month.

I've done 26 episodes so far, the first ones are there to show how tiny changes can have an impact on your spending and slowly episodes are branching out into self-sufficientcy as I'm optimising along the way. Again all the while tracking my changes and sharing them.

I don't earn money from the podcast, I simply do it to help others save money. I'm not trying to gain anything other than attract like minded people and help the environment without trying to make it political, it's just about making your finances healthier. If you're saving money, then you're already doing your bit for the planet.

I checked the sub rules and my posting my podcast doesn't break the rules (I'm not a commercial operation) so please note I'm trying to be respectful to the sub and I'm just trying to help. Thank you.

The podcast is called ""Zero Waste Money"". It's on iTunes and Spotify.

Anticonsumption,The ZeroWaste sub is victim blaming,"It is kind of ridiculous this is the face of environmentalism on Reddit. Ineffectual feel good babysteps nonsense that probably does worse than nothing because it allows people to think they can carry on their lifestyles with little modification and that everything will be fine. It won't be.

Imagine this scenario. In a tropical jungle they burn down all the trees. People from all over drive to the site and establish a plantation. They kill all the native fauna and flora and now just have coffee. More people use more resources to get to this plantation at harvest time where they pack all the beans in plastic bags and ship it to another facility. In this facility people drive from all over then they open all the plastic bags, dump them in the trash and burn fossil fuels to  roast all the beans. They then package this in plastic bags and ship it again to a food distributor. This food distributor then, with employees who drive from all over, unpacks all the bags, throws them in the trash and repackages them into smaller plastic bags and load them into trucks. They also wrap the packed pallets themselves in more plastic. The distributor now use diesel trucks to deliver these roasted beans to different retail points where people from all over drive to work and shop. At the retailer they unpack all  the bags, throw it in the trash, then put it into bins. Our hero now comes to the store with a glass container, scoops up a kilogram of the beans, weighs it and pats themselves on the back for being environmentally friendly. Congratulations you saved 2 grams of plastic. The additional weight of glass jars in your car likely offset that already.

99% of the waste of a product occurs out of sight before the point of retail. This is another strategy to shift the blame of environmental destruction from the flawed system of production to a consumer with no power. You want to help the environment? Don't fucking drink coffee.

Or products made from used materials? Or more businesses would crop up whose purpose is to fix and refurbish? Inevitably there would be adjustment periods, people will lose money...would it have to come down to an almost socialist society where money is spent on education (we need doctors etc and that money has to come from somewhere)...just thinking about it and wanting some opinions from people who are smarter and know more than I do (why I love Reddit).

Anticonsumption,Netflix and digital overconsumption,"I just bought a monthly subscription to Netflix and I am a bit puzzled by how they have screwed up what could be an impressive movies and series catalogue. 

The UI is totally ""instagramified"". It is all about the looks of it and not about the practicality or functionality. Videos that autoplay, cumbersome to click on a video to read the description without it going full screen and playing. Not a decent text search screen to browse the catalogue, just a heavy, overloaded, screen where the videos are ""sold"" to the users based on nice colours and tricky previews.

This is the same trend we see everywhere. Politics, social networks, consumer electronics. It is not anymore about the content. It is all about the looks of it. It is not about quality, it is about quantity. It is all about consuming without thinking. Consuming is not the mean anymore but the end of it.

I went on this date with a girl and I really really like her. I can’t explain it but we have a really strong connection and we will probably date. One of the foreseeable issues about us is that she’s a collector. She tells me about all the shoes she has and I’ve seen pictures of her excessive closet with multitudes of purses and clothes. She’s proud of it. It’s not like celebrity level excessive but it’s definitely a lot. 

She’s into fashion and stuff which I can respect but it’s hard for me to relate to this aspect of her interests. What should I do? I don’t want to shame her or be pushy about how to feel about consumption, but I don’t want to repress my feelings about consumer culture and collection.

Anticonsumption,Anticonsumption life skill; cooking.,"For everyone that thinks ""consumption is EVIL!!!"", let me know when you stop consuming food. For anyone else, I thought I'd type of some bits and bobs about how learning some basic kitchen skills (and, yes, sometimes even buying a bit of equipment) can help reduce your consumption overall.

First, cooking helps you use base ingredients. Tortillas and bread are not particularly difficult to make, but they can be quite difficult to find for sale without a lot of additives and wrapped in plastic. But even if you don't have access to a bulk store, flour, masa, salt, and the like are often sold in paper packages, and they're basically always cheaper per pound than bread. Are you a sucker for applesauce? A crockpot (you can get one used for $5) and some apples can fix you up with very little work. Having a hard time finding veggie burgers in reasonable packaging for a good price? With a little soaking, some dried beans (SUPER cheap) can becomes black bean burgers in no time; a little onion, a little seasoning, and you're in business.

Second, cooking lets you use thing other people may throw out. If you buy a whole chicken, for example, you get all the cuts for less than if you bought them individually, and all the ""scraps"" (backbone, etc.) can become broth. Also good for that broth; the tops of celery, greens and peeling from carrots, onions that have seen better days, etc. Is someone making jack-o-lanterns? They are probably going to discard the innards; wash them, salt them, and roast them. They're a great snack. Is the store getting rid of blemished peaches? No one can tell if the peaches in peach cobbler had a spot or three.

Third, and yes I really believe this, you are less likely to throw out or waste food you've cooked. I think that people value things more when they work for them, and that food you've made with your own hands has a better flavor because of it. It's easy to leave the last wing in the trough-for-ten from Big Al's fried chicken barn. But when you make the food, you know how much effort has gone into it.

Fourth, it gives you more control over what goes into your food. This gets into the ""don't let perfect be the enemy of good"" thing. Let's say you want to eat vegan, non-GMO food, but you can't find out if your favorite product is cooked in GMO-derived soybean oil, or with GMO potatoes, or if the sugar came from GMO sugarbeets (yes, these are all approved for human consumption and currently produce in the USA). Well, if you make you own, even if you can;t find non-GMO soybean oil, you can cook in something else; grapeseed oil, perhaps, or peanut (neither of which have GMO variants currently FDA approved for human consumption). You can by non-GMO potatoes, or specifically buy cane sugar (or agave syrup, or maple syrup, or apple honey).",2019-09-27 22:47:50,7,14

Anticonsumption,On individual action,"I'm sure a lot of you have seen [this comic](http://www.tmponline.org/wp-content/What-if-we-make-a-better-world-for-nothing.jpg). Note; that was just the first decent version that came up on a search, I neither know nor care what the website that's hosting it wants it for.

It's a nice, concise comic. Even if....IF....climate change wasn't real (which is almost certainly is), and even IF humans were not the cause of it, or at least not the SOLE cause of it (which we almost certainly are, at least in part), a lot of the things being proposed by climate change activists will improve the world anyway. It's like Sean Connery says in ""Finding Forrester""; ""It's like praying. What do you risk?""

I think individual action is a lot like that. If it should come to pass that everyone on earth has to not drive a car, or has to be a vegan, or whatever in service to our continued survival on this planet, why not start now? If you believe that the right thing to do is to do X, Y, and Z...why not do them, to the limit of your reasonable ability to do so? It's far more compelling to hear a proposal from someone about how X, Y, and Z work when they have lived that reality. It's much more persuasive to hear someone invite others to join their lifestyle rather than someone who doesn't live that lifestyle, but wants to use the government to MAKE everyone live it.

Don't misunderstand me; I'm not saying that individual actions alone are NECESSARILY going to solve these problems. They are big problems, and it behooves us to approach them collectively. But people should be convinced, not bullied. They should be persuaded, not coerced. Ask yourself this; who do you find more convincing? The person living the way they think is right, calmly and with dignity and willing to teach others? Or the person screaming and lambasting others, crying out for violence? I may disagree with you, but I won't insult you. I won't use a gun to make you do what I want, and I won't ask someone else to do it for me. If I think there is a right way, I'll talk to you about it for as long as you like. But if I can't convince you to stop driving a car...I have no right to take it away. Do what you think is right, and set a good example.",2019-09-24 12:26:10,6,0

Anticonsumption,Question on plastic grocery bags,"Going to post this to multiple subs, sorry if you see it more than once. 

TLDR: Is it better for the environment to recycle plastic grocery bags or use them to pick up trash during my daily walks?

I walk my dog 2.5 miles 5-6 days per week and for the last several weeks I've been picking up plastic trash with my pooper scooper, so 2 or 3 small plastic items I find on my walk, and throw it in the trash can half way through my walk.  Yesterday, though, I could have easily filled a plastic grocery bag with all the trash I saw.  So it got me thinking, is it better to use the plastic grocery bags we have on hand (usually we use reusable bags but still have enough plastic ones from times we forget) to pick up a lot of trash each time I walk or is it better to recycle all those bags and keep just picking up what fits in my pooper scooper?  

I don't think there is really a right or wrong answer to this question it's more subjective, but I look forward to seeing what everyone thinks.",2019-09-24 08:36:41,4,3

Today I recieved a paper letter from the Nordax Bank to ""collect my loans"" under a crap interest.

God damn, a simple visit to a website resulting in some information automatically gathered and sent off, analyzed and then sent to some direct marketing firm called ""IDM Adress"" who then sent me this direct market letter for an offer for Nordax Bank.

Also, the other week I was about to order tickets to a movie. Select our seats, started to fill-in payment information and email. While I'm doing this - I have not confirmed or proceeded with the payment - my wife says she's gonna add the time and location to our calendar (yes google) - turns out it was already added in detail to our calendar.

Anticonsumption,Looking for suggestions/tips: first anti-consumption holiday season with newborn.,"Hey all, 
My husband and I talk every year about opting out of the way our immediate families do Christmas (exchange lists, buy each other stuff on the lists, spend actual holiday eve and holiday opening stuff we bought each other). This practice hasn’t jived with our values in a long time but the pressure to participate can be overwhelming, particularly as our immediate kin on both sides tend to be very generous with what they give. I tend to put items on my list that I’ve wanted all year, but it’s typically practical stuff I’ve been too cheap or frugal to buy for myself. We aren’t big on stuff but it’s still nice to get things we have had on our list, and it’s nice to give stuff we know our family like. I often try to trend towards making items, but this practice is energy and time consuming and I’m not always consistent with follow thru. 

Our first child is due in November and we have already amassed a decent collection of gently used items for her, plus items which were bought or made for her and given at a recent shower. Again family has. been extremely generous and helpful, giving combo of new items, garages sale items, and hand-me-downs. 

Our feeling this year was that we want to teach our kid our values and to do so we need to continue to lean into them more and push ourselves to follow through with what we value. Additionally, we have been streamlining our budget to afford recent transition from 2 full time incomes to 1 full time income so I can be home with our daughter for 1-2 years. 

Basically, It hurts to even consider parting with our limited funds for the typical gift fest. Even in modest years we have spent any where from $500-$800 on others. So I’m looking for ideas about what others do during this consumer friendly holiday and wanting to hear suggestions for communicating our intentions to our family and friends. Ideally we could find a way to still spend time together with out all the pressure to give stuff. 

Thanks for your help.

Anticonsumption,Breaking away from a family of hoarders,"Forgive me if this isn't the proper sub. 

I'm almost 19 and I've lived in a house of hoarders my whole life. It's better now than it has been for most of my years, but entire rooms (yes, multiple) full of things that nobody uses is still inexcusable as far as I'm concerned. It's no TLC show but it's gnarly.

I would consider myself minimalist/anti-consumer/low-ish waste I suppose, but I have a few ideologies I still latch onto, perhaps because of my upbringing that logically I don't know if I agree with, despite being anti-con at heart:

1. Supporting new brands, particularly vegan ones, promotes that brand which is good and decreases animal suffering. It's worth the plastic packaging/convenience.

2. Purchasing distilled water from plastic gallons is overall worth it because I enjoy it and will drink more. Staying hydrated is essential to life, so it is okay (note: there is no recycling center withen 50 miles of my current house and virtually all of the empty jugs get trashed, not that recycling is exactly efficient either)

3. Buying new clothes from stores like Ross, Walls, etc. is okay because my style is unique and rarely do thrift stores have clothes I like in very slim sizes. Being genderqueer/gnc, presentation is important to me, therefore supporting fast fashion is justified. (This one in particular bothers me a lot, because I feel like attaching this much value to my appearance to begin with is likely unhealthy and well, stupid. Learning how to sew/tailor would likely help. I have no excuse for this one)

4. I was very into art as a pre-teen and acquired a collection of Copic and Prismacolor markers, as well as artist-grade colored pencils of various brands. I no longer use these supplies but don't want to give them away or sell them as they cost hundreds of dollars in total, and it would offend my parents who bought them for me. These are the only things I have hoarded, and everything else I own plus whatever ends up in my room from the rest of the house gets sorted through and purged at least once a month.

I'm far from where I'd like to be on my ""minimalist journey,"" per se. I am (hopefully) moving soon and don't want any of the shit from my hoarder parents and ungrateful sister following me ANYWHERE, physical shit or mental baggage. Any advice for living simply and not consuming constantly to fill a void or otherwise is appreciated. I'm young and I want to start my adult life properly.

I've always felt a lot of distaste for living the fast and comfortable life and the endless pursuit of wealth. 

But I'm a consumer too and participate in this because this is what my world has been. I've now been conditioned to loving meat, ordering take out, having used plastic bags, etc. The most peace I've ever felt in my life was when I was with nature. As such, I dream of living an indigenous life even though it has its challenges.

I've been suicidal for years but after I discovered and pursued spiritual beliefs and harmony with everything around, I've felt an extremely strong connection with life and everything there is. Sometimes I wish I could live off a small patch of land, farm food for myself and roam with nature.

But I hope the 21st-century will come up with a ""neoindigenous"" solution. Where we can provide ecological solutions and still keep the convenience that technology gives us. I hope we see the error of our ways and realise our beautiful connection with nature.",2019-09-15 06:58:32,12,23

Anticonsumption,I am an Ecosocialist,"  I am an ecosocialist; I am going to take your cars, your lawns, your pork, your beef, your sugar, corn and soybean subsidies, commercial flying and most commercial trucking, and I am going to indoctrinate your children into my ideology. Oh but you get to keep your assault weapons, but not at home. They will be in actual regulated militias, and gay and black people get their own militias, too. Shotguns and hunting rifles are a okay at home, with the proper regulations and social investment. 

 You are also going to get free at the point of service (financed through taxes), education, preschool through PhD, free healthcare, an unconditional basic income, radically expanded social and council housing (so a right to a roof over your head), nationalized (therefore way cheaper) cell coverage, fiber Internet service, car insurance and maintenance, nationalized home, life and property insurance. We are going to make the oligarchs pay for all this. They have 22 trillion dollars sitting in tax havens. And the faster we get to consolidating population density and downsizing our carbon footprint, the more of our lifestyle we will get to keep. 

  10 years from now, nationalized buyback programs will put 80 percent of cars in government run rental companies, we are only going to be able to eat beef and pork once or twice a month, we are going to have to force tens of millions of people to move, but that doesn't mean that life has to suck. We will probably have more variety in food, we will still be able to eat poultry, eggs and dairy pretty much all we want, we will still be able to travel, just mainly by train and probably by boat, instead of flying, we can still take our families on road trips, we will still have Gucci, Dulce and Gabbana and shopping malls, we will still have smart phones, just not a new one every year, or even every two years, we will still live in houses, just not houses with lawns. We will have a lot more time off, we will live in vibrant, closer knit neighborhoods, we will have more hobbies ( formerly expensive hobbies like horseback riding, sailing, things like that will get a lot more affordable), we will participate in civics and politics and be proud of the transparent and accountable institutions we create. And the faster we get to consolidating population density and downsizing our carbon footprint, the more of our lifestyle we will get to keep. 

Our air and water will be cleaner, we will take turns enjoying the countryside, visiting its' cabins, villages, farms and small towns. We will live in a society where we treat labor as the dignified professions they are, instead of the extractive brutality we put custodians, servers, cooks, CNAs, construction workers, etc. through. We will plant one trillion trees, create 100 million new acres of wetlands, clean the oceans, and build 2,500 miles of rail lines. We will pursue mass decarceration of nonviolent crimes, test the tens of thousands of rape kits sitting in police stations, and hold Nuremberg trials for 20th century capitalism. 

We will be able to visit the rainforests, beaches and coral reefs in the global south with our families, rest assured that we have helped put them on paths towards social democracy and real socialism, and that American's reputations have not been completely ruined as thugs and indifferent bullies. Why do we have to do all of this? There isn't any combination of alternative energy that will keep all the cars running and allow us to hit the carbon emission targets we need to stabilize the planet's climate and keep this planet habitable for humans. The science about climate change got much more pessimistic in the past two years. The oceans are dying, plummeting insect numbers could mean the end of agriculture as we know it, and as of August, 2019, we are at the tipping point for the entire Amazon drying out and turning into spontaneously burning savannah and temperate forest-one of the last things stopping runaway climate change, which will result in dead oceans-dead oceans don't produce oxygen.

[**https://www.ebay.com/itm/303281120629**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/303281120629) 

# [Partial of the video’s text]

# Luke 18:24-26 (KJV)

**24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!**

**25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.**

**26 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?**

**Not only is “The Moment” speaking of “rich persons”, but the mindset of desiring control of external trappings. It is the mindset that leads you down the path of bloated thinking. Where you’re no longer able to be flexible enough to maneuver, let alone squeeze through, any aperture of thought-architecture that isn’t accommodating to your habits of over-indulged, material conceptions.**

**Where as the abstract inherently exists in its malleable architecture of diverse ambiguity that exerts one’s thinking to a flexible svelteness for the flexibility to enter in a wider and grander universal access.**

**We only have to be reminded of the relative absurdities and outrages of the normal process and their outlier anomalies to get a tangible grasp on the extent to which materiality subverts and degrades in its ‘shiny object’ allure of attraction and aspiration for those seeking the illusory promised rewards of the material life.**

**Don’t be led to believe that abstractionism is another substitute for your satiating desires for possession or control. Abstractionism is the operational instrument of minimalist functionality. It is the discerning filter for what is essential versus what is elective-to-frivolous. In the misconception of material freedom and its “liberties’, one feels from that belief in material freedom that one has a license of liberty for a host of THINGS, which enchant the mind’s inspiration and motivations. Much like the ‘Tarbaby’ or a spider’s web, it is a snare to entrap you in conditions for which escape is difficult, if not futile.**

**Functional minimalism is the bare-bones of operational functions. If it’s not needed for some immediate or associative to an immediate need, it’s superfluous for that moment. In this way you don’t clutter your cognitive field with those predispositioned urges from an over-extended sensory license of indulgent desires. By being in that state of a focused sensory field and minimal cognitive ‘juggling’, your brain/mind is more able to be a receptor of awareness of more subtle transmission that would be lost in the other sensory and cognitive noise.**

Anticonsumption,Junk Mail PSA (US),"If a company sends you junk mail (aka direct mail, for the marketing industry) - you can contact them directly and request that you be added to their ""do not mail"" list. 

If enough people did this, it would END JUNK MAIL. (theoretically)

It is Very rare for a company to not respect this (I've worked in an adjacent industry for 5 years, and I've never heard of such a request not being honored.) 

2 things to keep in mind:
* These lists are pulled ~4 weeks (or more) in advance, so you still might receive a stray mailing before you are suppressed from their lists.
* BE NICE to the customer service rep on the phone. It's not their fault they work for (or more likely subcontract for) a company that uses Stone age marketing channels.

Companies expect a 17% ROI on these things and often get substantially less. The only reason the channel is cost effective is that businesses get an (artificially) low rate from the USPS.  A medium size company will send out tens of millions of these pieces over the course of a year, because they in the whole see a marginal return, or at least believe they do.

My mother in law recently moved across country and is now just a few hours from us, so now is visiting every couple weekends. She and her girlfriend love to cook and we too are what you would call foodies. I love that they want to cook for us and appreciate that she shares recipes with us. 

However she goes grocery shopping and ends up buying a lot of things we already have, or don't use on a regular basis. Milk for example, we don't drink it and they know it. They alway buy a quart, so they can put a couple tablespoons in their coffee. That is fine that they want it for their coffee, but then they leave it and it gets wasted. They have a recipe they want to cook and I tell them that I have some of the ingredients. They buy them anyway. 

So far what I have tried, is to get them to use the ingredients we have. They won't. I have even said here it is please use this instead and they won't. 
I have asked her to look at what we have before they go shopping. Didn't work.
I have asked her to text me her list so I can let her know what not to buy. She never has. 

They left a couple hours ago. I looked in my fridge and the salad mix that I had, that i told them to use instead of the one they bought for lunch, is untouched and the salad mix they bought is half gone. 
The milk I told them to take with them is there. 
The mustard they bought and I told not to open because we had a mustard already open, is in the fridge with a tablespoon scooped out of it.

This isn't anything huge but as someone who literally always threw out things out and didn't bother trying to fix them, I'm really proud of myself and want to keep working on it.

Anticonsumption,To save the world we need to change THE WORLD... but how?," We know that most future global emissions will come from developing countries seeking to move out of poverty. We know that even the most drastic progress in reducing emissions in developed countries will be negligible in the wider picture. We know that 99.999% of all human beings - including most of us - would place ending our own poverty before the well-being of the planet. And we know that the developed nations are in no position to moralise to developing nations having ourselves done most of the environmental damage and benefited most from it.

So, what are we to do?

Let's pretend that the systematic changes that XR advocates in developed nations like the UK are achieved. Let's pretend that in everything that XR aspires that it attains 100% success. What now China? What now India? What now Brazil? What now all other developing nations aspiring to live as we in the West do? Can they rise out of poverty without exploiting natural resources? If so, then how so? And what can we do to help? If they cannot, then how do we convince them to delay their own economic growth for the good of the planet? Do we attempt to set an example by living more austere lives? Do we hit them with economic sanctions? Do we invade them using our military superiority to force into place policies that are good for the whole world rather than just them? Do we do similar in our own countries to set an example and precedent?

We are told that we have a global emergency... but do we have a global plan? And if we have a plan, then is there a viable strategy? Is there a plausible process for achieving our goals? Or is XR doomed to collapse in on itself like the Occupy movement did as viable plans, solutions and ideas are found wanting?",2019-09-06 00:09:06,2,8

Anticonsumption,Thought: sustainable practices are more convenient than unsustainable ones,"Typically, environmentally conscious actions are seen as less convenient and that stops people from doing them. But the way I see it, they’re often more convenient and should be talked about in that way. 

Take razors for example. My safety razor came with a pack of 5 razor blades and each one lasts me about a month. Only having to buy one pack every 5 months is way more convenient than having to buy a pack of disposable razors every 2 months. It’s also better because I just have to store the 1.5” long pack instead of a large bag of plastic razors.

Another example is menstrual products. It used to be super stressful having to remember if I had enough pads left and having to go buy them. With cloth pads I never have to buy more and I know I’m gonna have enough because by the time that starts up again they’re all clean and ready to go. 

Don’t have to worry about having enough water bottles for the week if you can just refill a reusable from the tap. Don’t have to worry about having enough herbs if you can trim your windowsill herb plants whenever you need them. Don’t have to spend two hours shopping for a new pair of shoes if I can glue the sole back on in a few minutes. Etc etc.",2019-09-04 22:35:50,4,36

I just wanted to introduce us. We are the UK food charity called 'Food For All' based in the City of London. Throughout the year for the last 30 years we have been collecting and cooking food waste and surplus and redistributing it throughout London.

We are going to be working with the Extinction Rebellion to cook 15,000 hot meals each day during the October protests this year. Some of you have probably met us at other events, including the big London events earlier this year, and I'm sure some of you will end up volunteering in our kitchen in October.

We have just started a new project to inspire people around the world to develop their own free food projects by redistributing food waste to those in need. This is our Facebook and Instagram and Twitter for anyone who wants to get involved..

I know I shouldn't buy more, but the things I don't have just seem much more tempting than the things I don't have. How can get excited about the things I already have?

Some ideas I have:

* Create an online inventory of all books, CDs, computer games, DVDs, blu-ray, vinyl I have, and identify things I haven't actually experienced once (those 'never unwrapped' things) and prioritise giving them at least a once over.
* Set my homepage on my PC to be this online inventory so instead of going to Amazon I have a list of things that I already have that I could explore.
* Get other friends to recommend things out of my inventory list to me - 'Oh you have this, you should really watch this film again' etc.

My cousin (20M) has become very environmentally-conscious and against consumerism recently. While this is admirable, he has taken it to an extreme and says that American society is far too focused on consumption of products, and he has decided to quit his job to move out West to live a simple live off of his significant savings (Given he wants to have almost no electricity, no car, and live off of cheap foods, he could actually live for several years off his savings (still <$100K though) with this lifestyle). For entertainment, he has an old E-reader which he has loaded a large library of books onto to improve his knowledge.

I know young people will often take a gap year after college but this is not a gap year... He plans to move out West indefinitely leaving his friends and family on the East coast behind. He has a college degree in a lucrative field so it was not like he didn’t have good prospects. I keep telling him that being environmentally-friendly is great but this is a drastic step. He responds that this is the only morally correct decision and he is not going to let any emotions get in the way of his decision. He doesn't want to contribute to harming the environment in any way.

Does he have a point? Should everyone who can afford it quit their jobs to live very simple lives? Is it immoral to do anything else?",2019-08-31 13:11:07,10,18

Anticonsumption,Start your own free food project and help us to reduce food waste and poverty," Hello. I work with the UK food charity Food For All. We've been feeding you guys and gals at some of your demonstrations around London. Apparently some of you are interested in helping to tackle the insane food waste problem around the world, so we have a proposal for you.

We are on a mission to inspire people around the world to start and develop their own free food services, redistributing local food waste to help reduce poverty in their communities.

It's very simple... In every community in the world there is food waste, and in every community in the world there are people struggling to put food on the table. All that we are looking for is the goodhearted people to collect that waste food, prepare it, and then redistribute it.

The form that takes is down to the individuals and groups, their resources, and the local need. In London at our main kitchen, we turn the waste / surplus food that we collect into hot meals that we distribute at public locations. But we also take pastries and cakes and hand them out o commuters as an act of kindness. And, if we have a ridiculous amount of produce come in, we set up a little 'free food market' in a busy area and hand it out for free. And so on. It really is as you wish and as you are capable.

Now, we are a registered UK food bank charity, so to give you the credibility to collect from local stores etc. all we need to do is register you as a volunteer, and, thereafter, you have the license to go to any food outlet and make arrangements to collect their food waste and surplus.

The projects that you set up and develop will be autonomous. You will have the freedom and the responsibility to develop your own project as you see best. We'll do some initial checks to ensure that the people interested have the correct motivations (we don't want to start a rampant black market!), and we'll provide some guidance to help you get going, but other than that we trust your intelligence and your heart to do the best job possible.

It really is so simple. We just need the people now - the kind hearts who want to make a difference. And I promise you... the first time you give someone a free meal, even if just a pastry, your life will be changed, and you will be hooked. If you think you might be interested then please reply / message me. And if you want to help us on our way then check out our social media and help us get this idea out there. I have no doubt that in a short amount of time we could have hundreds, if not thousands, of free food services popping up all around the world.

What if there was to start being storefronts like this... stocked with fast fashion brands but encouraging people to rent rather than buy? 

Is it still bad to even stock a store with these clothing items, or is the possible pay-off of people choosing to not purchase as much of their own clothing worth it?

Anticonsumption,Complaints about university life,"I live in a college dorm and there are so many habits that my peers have that seem so wasteful and drive me insane. For example, everyone I know uses paper plates and bowls and plastic utensils to eat in their room (I have a set of ceramic and glass dishes that I handwash), no one will drink the tap water (to be fair, it does have a slight weird taste, but I put lemon in my water bottle and it doesn't taste that weird) and so many people just have huge cases of plastic water bottles.  Overall, the prevalence of single-use and disposable items drives me kind of insane, especially because people just do not know the difference between what goes in the recycling bin and what goes in the garbage.

To make matters worse, we have people (both the school and companies) handing out random free stuff to us all the time. I'm guilty of taking some of it, and some items were useful, but a lot of it was just free advertising or random bottles of water. The Amazon store also gave out boxes full of free samples from different brands and a plastic bottle of water, along with an ad for Brita filters encouraging us to buy a filter pitcher to cut down on plastic bottle purchases. 

I would like to come up with ways to encourage my peers to consume more consciously and use more reusable items, but I'm not sure how to do so without seeming like I think I'm better than anyone (I understand that a lot of people grow up with a lifestyle that involves a lot of consumption since that's the norm for us pretty much and that it isn't easy to relearn habits you've had for 18 years.)

I was raised to be very conscious about this kind of thing and also taught stuff like how to do my own dishes, easy ways to make food instead of buying it premade, etc (which might come from having some periods of financial insecurity during my childhood). I feel like so many people get to the point of living away from their parents for the first time and don't know how to actually do anything themselves so they're dependent on prepackaged, single-use disposable items that take most of the thinking out of it.",2019-08-25 17:43:33,2,17
Anticonsumption,"Reality check for folks concerned about excess packaging/plastic straws. If you’re driving around in a SUV, that’s what you need to correct first.","Just found out that Ford is discontinuing nearly all of their sedan production in favor of SUVs and trucks. Before you jump all over the corporate greed BS, first realize that they are doing so because their sedans aren’t selling anymore now that gas prices have dropped. In other words, now that gas prices are low and seem to be staying that way, everyone is back to buying gas guzzling SUVs and trucks. 

Really sad actually as they make good sedans/hybrids, but will be churning out only gas guzzlers until further notice. Yes, companies are interested in making a profit. Everyone here earns a paycheck from a company that makes a profit, and said paycheck comes from said profit. If you live off government assistance (no shame in that if you need it) that money also comes from companies that make a profit. But.....if there is no demand for fuel efficient vehicles, there is no point in continuing to design/test/build/sell them. That’s not Fords fault. That’s the fault of people buying gas guzzlers instead of more sensible options. 

If you buy an SUV, you’re the only one in it most of the time, and you don’t need it to tow anything, don’t say anything to me about plastic straws/bags. 

The amount of resources used to make a straw/bag is negligible compared to the extra amount of gas (2-3x) it takes to drive around in an SUV vs something smaller. 

I realize that waste is a part of the plastic straw/bag argument as well. Fair enough. First of all, your plastic bags/straws are not ending up in the ocean. Their ending up in a landfill, which I agree is not good. But again, the waste you generate by driving an SUV vs a small car is what you really should be focused on.",2019-08-25 14:55:42,59,140

Anticonsumption,An unwashed brain is a happy brain,"Around 10 years ago, I was paying over $100/mo. for satellite TV. I noticed that most of the time what was on the screen was cartoons for my then five-year-old son. I decided to it was a waste and cut the service off. As an experienced Internet user, I knew where to get all the TV I wanted, commercial free.
That combined with stringent use of adblockers on all web browsers in our house meant that my son grew up as close to ad and commercial free as possible.
The effect was, he didn’t have the “I wants” that I have seen most kids have. When asked what he wanted for Christmas or his birthday, he would have to give it some real thought. He developed his own tastes and style and he often voices distain for the trends his peers follow.
As for myself, I haven’t watched a commercial in years. When I do see an ad, either in print, on TV, or even the side of a bus, I tune it out automatically. It is almost like I have “They Live” glasses on.
I find myself without the desire to buy things unless I need them for a specific purpose. I shake my head in amusement as I listen to my friend or co-workers talking about how that they saw this or that and just “had to buy it”. 
Life is so much more satisfying without the constant bombardment of false need perpetuated by marketing.

-	I regularly look at EDC or fashion blogs to see if there’s something that might be useful for me.

I have had much success with my money spending on useless items, but I feel like it’s a constant struggle. I haven’t ordered food from outside in 1 week, I haven’t bought anything else besides groceries, I bring my own shopping bag wherever I go.

But my question is, how do I understand my urges and my behavior so that I can rewire or at least understand my brain better? I studied some consumer psychology, but it only answers the what, and not the why and how behind consumer behavior.

Also..

What are some more practical and useful things that you guys apply to your daily to help reduce unnecessary consumption?

Thanks so much!",2019-08-19 05:00:36,14,22
Anticonsumption,I have some interesting thing to ask you guys,"Hello everyone, I just learned something, and I wanted to ask all of you guys(those who really care and want changes). First of all today's most trendy thing is global warming, disposable containers, plastic recycling and so on. We are soooo concerned about these things and yet... look at the products in any store, there is plastic bags, boxes and so on. It's like we would constantly talk about how cigarettes would harm your health and life in general, while having cigarette in our hands, smoking, at the same time!

&#x200B;

And here is my question. What do you think would happen, if we, as a human species in whole world, WOULD agree on having 8 types of containers for all our drinks, yogurts, beers, milks and so on( here I mean everyday consumed products, of course there would be more containers in some special industry)? These containers would be in durable glass, that not only easy to dispose and recycle, but also easy to wash and use again and again, so it mean, you can drink your milk, NOT THROWING AWAY bottle(and even if you do, glass not even close to be as bad as plastic bottle are, to throw away, it doesn't poison anything) but bring it to special place, where you get money for your bottle, I mean like 0.4 cent each AT LEAST, so manufactures can get back their bottle, wash it and refill. What do you care if your next beer bottle will have very same bottle as previous one?! Even if you care though, you might calm yourself down, by thinking on how not having proprietary bottles for each product is saving a lot of energy, money, nature, reduce amount of waste and so on. This is not some garbage idea like changing plastic straws on paper straw(although it is something), this is complete game and WORLD changer.  How great is that guys?

&#x200B;

Give me your feedback and after that I'll edit this post, to reveal some interesting thing.",2019-08-19 03:31:36,8,6

Anticonsumption,Books/psychology on consumerism.,"Hello, 

I was hoping this sub could help me. Ironically enough I am looking for a book or some kind of resource that can help me understand what materialism is doing, and how to stop it in my life. 

Sadly I ony ever found one book called:  **The High Price of Materialism** by  **Tim Kasser.**   
This book spoke of the ill effects that materialism have. People growing more agressive etc, he also backed it up with studies and such.

The book to my opinion was lacking in the department of 'how do I break the cycle of consumerism/materialism.' I mean I've been buying shit I do not want all my life. I am ashamed that I decided to buy a certain brand of beer because they have that freebie with it. It's pathetic, no I am pathetic for falling for it.

So I am in the market for a book that can help me understand my behaviour and tells me how to put a stop to it. I think consumerism, social media and tv especially have a big influence on us. 

Now I really feel skeptic about those self-help books that seem to have bounced psychology out of the book shelves. So I hope you maybe know a nice read or can tell me what started you on this path as I want to follow it. 

Lately I've been overspending buying bullshit and it has to stop....

I just do not know where to start really.

Thanks!",2019-08-18 08:29:26,9,14

The 4 of them altogether brand new probably costed about $100.

When I got this job i was worried I would have to spend money I don’t have to buy a new wardrobe since I didn’t have anything.

I took my blazers and the coat to a dry cleaner and it costed me about $40 which is not so little but I would have spent way more on new blazers and a coat + have a lot more in my closet because of my old stuff.

Anticonsumption,American Green — a list of some things the lawn industry does not want you to know.,"*  Between 1994 and 2004, an estimated average of 75,884 Americans *per year* were injured using lawn mowers or roughly the same number of people injured by firearms.
* Using a gas-powered leaf blower for half an hour creates as many  polluting hydrocarbon emissions as driving a car seventy-seven hundred  miles at a speed of thirty miles per hour.
* Nearly half of the households sampled in one study failed to  carefully read and follow the label directions when using pesticides and  fertilizer.
* Approximately seven million birds die each year because of lawn-care pesticides.
* In the process of refueling their lawn mowers, leaf blowers, and  other garden equipment, Americans spill about seventeen million gallons  of gasoline every summer, or about 50 percent more oil than marred the  Alaskan coast during the notorious Exxon *Valdez* disaster.
* A single golf course in Tampa, Florida — a state that leads the  nation with over a thousand of these emerald green creations — uses  178,800 gallons of water per day, enough to meet the daily water needs  of more than twenty-two hundred Americans.
* Suburban households and lawn-care operators apply more herbicides per acre on lawns than most farmers spread to grow crops.
* Of the approximately sixty thousand landscape workers in California  subject to leaf-blower noise every day, less than one in ten is likely  to be wearing hearing protection.
* Diazinon, for decades a widely used lawn-care pesticide similar in  chemical composition to nerve gas but touted as safe, was finally banned  by the E.P. A. in 2000, and yet a loophole allowed retailers to go  right on selling it as late as 2002.
* Lawn chemicals are commonly tracked into the home, where they build  up in the carpet, thus placing small children, whose developing bodies are far more vulnerable to toxins, at risk of chronic exposure.

Unfortunately, my last window fan broke after two seasons when the blades stopped spinning due to the oil freezing in winter. That one was the cheap plastic Holmes fan. I’m curious if anyone can recommend a high quality, “buy it for life” window fan that can be easily taken apart and cleaned or oiled.

Additionally, my last floor fan met a similar fate when I tried to take it apart to clean the blades. The plastic frame cracked when I was trying to pry it open. That was a cheap Vornado fan.

I’ve already checked my local thrift store and it’s just a bunch of small junky floor fans that look equally difficult to clean. Any suggestions?",2019-08-07 22:22:54,1,2

* No spending money Monday-Friday. Any grocery shopping has to be done on Saturday or Sunday.   

* No buying something from X category until I have used up whatever I have from the same category, even if I don't like what I currently have. For instance I can't buy more food if I already have food at home. I can't buy more sunscreen until I have used up all the old bottles around my house.  

* No throwing out things that I have storage space for. There is too much temptation to buy a new version. Clothes for an example.   

* Never upgrading electronics until they stop working.  

* Reusing packaging multiple times before recycling, e.g. using old plastic bags to store or wrap food.",2019-08-07 09:59:26,9,28

Anticonsumption,Reducing food waste is good for the environment and your pocketbook. Here's some tips.,"Food waste in the U.S. really bothers me. It's not just the cost at the individual level of the food that's going in the trash, it's so much more than that. A farmer raised and tended those crops. They were harvested and shipped to a facility to sort them out and package them. They were shipped yet again to a distribution point, then again to your local grocery store. Tons of valuable resources (money, water, fertilizer, fuel, and time!) went in to getting that food to you.

Then there IS the personal cost on an individual or family level. I hear people joking about just buying groceries and dumping them directly in the trash outside the store because that's how much food they throw out. And I get it. It can be hard to use up fresh produce in time, especially if you don't want to be hitting the grocery store 2x a week (I certainly don't). But this kind of waste has a real impact, and it's something we can really cut down on very, very easily. But I don't want to preach.

Rather, what I'd like to do is share some tips to reduce food waste that I use. These are simple, every day things that anyone can do (I'm super lazy, actually, but these are simple) and they are by no means my own ideas, just things I didn't think of doing until I heard about them. I hope they are helpful tips.

**Fruit/veggies** about to go off? Freezing them is the obvious go-to. Veggies can be used in soups/casseroles/bakes whatever. Fruit can go into smoothies, oatmeal, in your breakfast cereal, in baked goods (muffins, etc). This is especially true for bananas about to go off, browned bananas make great banana bread/muffins. This is perfectly edible food that shouldn't be allowed to rot in refrigerators. Meat, too, but I think more people freeze meat (due to its higher cost) and don't consider freezing veggies before they go off.

**Vegetable scraps** \- Can be frozen and used to make veggie stock or add to meat ends to add more flavor to a meat stock. These odds and ends add up quickly and can make a really delicious broth.

Sidenote: This is easy to do in a crock pot, just put everything in with some water and herbs/seasoning and let sit on low for 8 hours or high for 4. InstantPot too, but for less time, obviously.

Another option for veggie scraps is composting for gardening, so if you have a garden, why not turn veggie scraps into free food for your garden? Egg shells and coffee grinds can be composted as well and help make a very rich compost for your garden. I don't garden (I have managed to kill cacti for god's sake -- my veggie scraps become stock), but my parents do. They keep a Tupperware container by the sink and fill it with debris as necessary, then dump it a couple times a week in their composter.

**Cooked chicken bones/skin/fat/gristle, beef bones and gristle, fish bones**, etc. Freeze these and use them (alone or with vegetable scraps) to make chicken/beef/seafood stock. These are items that are tossed out but still have use to them, and the stock will be way tastier than something store-bought. Crockpot (or InstantPot) for the win here as well!

**Think outside the box** while cooking - Sure, that chicken tortilla soup recipe doesn't call for bell pepper, but you have 1/4 a bell pepper leftover. Toss it in. A lot of vegetables and recipes are very flexible. Be creative.

**Plan ahead** \- Plan your weekly meals out in advance, shop appropriately. I use a meal planning app which stores recipes and generates a grocery list. This helps me buy what is needed for the week and, more importantly, eat what I buy. You can also plan for leftovers, i.e. you make a roast chicken one night but you know there will be leftovers. Chicken enchiladas, chicken tortilla soup, chicken noodle soup, chicken salad (either kind, the one with lettuce or the one that goes on sandwiches), just as an example.

**Consider frozen** \- If you find yourself throwing out a lot of produce, consider buying frozen. Frozen fruit and vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh and keeps much longer.

**Canning/pickling** is another option to use up food, though I think most of us just don't accidentally buy, say, 10 lbs of apples. But if you're gifted a large amount of fruit or vegetables (or you have fruiting trees/a garden), canning can be a great option - especially if you have canning supplies on-hand. Just be sure to follow instructions carefully (including adjustments for processing time due to sea level) to avoid botulism.

Sidenote: I don't do much canning but I do a lot of lacto-fermentation which is another method of food preservation. There's a whole subreddit, r/fermentation, that often discusses making pickles, hot sauces, miso, all kinds of things via lacto-fermentation. I personally don't do it on a large scale, but a mason jar here and there of lacto-fermenting vegetables doesn't take up much space and is a great use of vegetables.

**Dehydration** \- dehydrating fruits and vegetables is another great option to reduce waste. Not gonna spend a lot of time on this because if you have a dehydrator, you're probably already doing this.

**Co-ops and ""ugly"" food**: Some companies are buying up unattractive produce from groceries stores (food that is perfectly edible, but not pretty enough, and would otherwise be thrown away) and re-sell them at a lower cost. There's a lot of newer companies doing this with the Blue Apron structure; I think those actually often generate even more waste (why is everything individually packaged?), but there are some doing it more like a co-op where the food is brought to centralized locations across a city and you can go and pick it up.

This is a good method of reducing waste and saving money. On that note, co-ops and farmer's markets that feature locally grown produce can reduce waste as well, as the food isn't traveling as far. That being said, some farmer's markets are quite pricey so YMMV. I have had good luck with co-ops, though, and they are great for big families because you often get a big box of produce (which you can then freeze/can/dehydrate/make scraps into stock, etc.)

Most of these tips only take a few minutes to implement, and those that take longer can still streamline your day and save time in other areas (meal planning I'm looking at you).

So my next project. I am currently going into my senior year of undergrad. I work in a cancer research lab and love it; however, the waste amount is crazy! So much plastic in the garbage. My PI tries to reduce waste as much as possible by reusing non-dirty gloves and reusing old pipette tip boxes as containers for other projects, but we still have so much waste. Do any anti-consumption lab rats have ideas on how we can reduce waste? My PI is very open to ideas about this as he is one of the least wasteful people I have ever met.",2019-07-31 10:45:11,5,3

Anticonsumption,See the horizons of the materialistic end-game,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The End-Game has arrived for Materialism

&#x200B;

The philosophical underpinning for materialism as stated  in the Declaration of Independence gave license for the acquisition and hoarding-to-indulgence of the tangible and intangible trappings of ""happiness"". Its logical progeny of derivatives for the individual to tailor a such a happiness fir for himself has stretched the bounds of both the resources available and the limits into the realms of relative equivalency.

&#x200B;

Like it or not, 'materialism' as the means and measure to the ends of ""the pursuit of happiness"" has unleashed the genie-of-desires to be manifested as Faustian bargains whose ends of material comfort and security on an emotional and physical basis justify what ever means one can (in impunity) can achieve.

&#x200B;

The economic systems created for the aiding and abetting of this paradigm-be they capitalistic or socialistic-provide the intellectual rationale for the license of its practitioners  to go to those amoral, asymmetric lengths of aspiration and execution to have their fulfillment of those paradigms.

&#x200B;

We see on both the tangible and intangible levels the degradation of the systems that were taken for granted, if not just indifferently plundered, for the literal and figurative good they provided to the pursuing indulgents of material trappings.

&#x200B;

Materialism, because it is based and practiced on an individual and subjective level of satisfaction, inherently reduces and subordinates those things beyond the self-serving (even if seemingly benign) as an after-thought. As such, any holistic, altruistic, selfless intention becomes the marginal outlier of behavior; as a result we're witnessing the testament of that lacking and dearth of those qualities being the motivating and organizing principle for our temporal existence.",2019-07-23 20:29:16,0,3

Anticonsumption,Replacement/upcycling suggestion thread,"I have been trying to consume less and in line with that, I have been brainstorming replacements I can make to things I want or need. I was hoping for some feedback and ideas in this thread on the kinds of alternatives I could consider. Of course, individual action pales in comparison to what can be done on the corporation scale, but that doesn't mean I'm not still interested in reducing my individual footprint.

Please also feel free to make a top-level comment if there is something you have wanted to replace with a lower-impact or lower-waste alternative, and maybe people here can help you out.

🌱 Replacements I have made:

* **Fruit and vegetables**. It's not perfect, but I've made a dent in the amount of imported fruit and veg I buy just by growing broccoli, chilis, tomatoes, herbs, and strawberries. I don't have much space, but I managed to get something out of a tiny allotment and a window box.

* **Liquid hand soap**. I still use antimicrobial hand soap in my kitchen because of food prep concerns, but I swapped to bar soap in my bathroom and am transitioning to a solid shampoo. It lasts longer, I can get it from local companies with a transparent-ish supply chain, and you can often get plastic-free options.

* **Energy drinks**. This was a bit of an embarrassing one for me, but I've been working out a lot and they motivate me to get to the gym, as well as improve my performance while I'm there. I replaced it with an *iced coffee* stock I keep in a jar in the fridge. Still consuming the coffee, but it is something I would be buying anyway, so the overall waste footprint is lower and I have more faith in the ethics of the (local) coffee company I buy from.

* **Tools**. I was fortunate enough to find a [Tool Library](https://edinburghtoollibrary.org.uk/) in my city (you might find one like this if you have a maker space) which allows me to borrow tools rather than buying new ones which rarely get used. On a similar note, the bike shop will often fix things up for me instead of needing to buy the tools to do it myself. 

* **Water bottle**. Speaks for itself. I like to make iced tea concentrates as an alternative to drinks I would otherwise buy. The teas I already have in my cupboard, and it stops me buying a pre-made drink. Would be nice to learn to make kombucha, in this regard, but I would need to somehow source a SCOBY...

* **Menstrual cup**. This has greatly reduced my need to buy sanitary products.

I am also looking to transition to bulk-buying things to save on waste (e.g. oats by the gram), but it's difficult to find alternatives in my small city. I have been trying to reduce my meat consumption too, but it's difficult to consistently get the amount of protein I need for lifting with a completely vegan diet, so I haven't managed to completely phase it out. Finally, I am trying to digitise my note-taking, although this one is really challenging as I don't absorb things the same way as when I make paper notes.

🌱 Things I've been wanting, but would like to find an alternative to:

* **Foam roller**. I am full of aches and pains from lifting weights and I see these recommended a lot. Is there any replacement I can use (other than static stretching) that doesn't require purchasing anything new? Maybe a DIY?
* **Running shoes**. I unfortunately have to replace these every few hundred miles, which feels extremely wasteful. Would appreciate tips on how to make them last longer and how I can recycle the old ones. Right now they just get used for pottering around the garden.
* **New clothes and bags**. My daily-use backpack is five years old and it is developing a hole. Lots of my clothing has holes, too, due to not wanting to throw things away if they can still be used. Any recommended resources for fixing things without the requirement for a sewing machine? Particularly for jeans, which always wear through at the inner thigh.
* **Lab stuff**. Unconventional, but I work in a lab and the plastic use is through the roof. Much of this cannot be avoided due to sterility concerns, but I recently learned that spin columns can be recycled, suggesting that there may be options to reduce consumption! Does anyone have other creative suggestions for re-use or recycling in a lab setting?

Thanks all, hope this thread is not too out of place. Looking forward to hearing any suggestions.",2019-07-23 10:27:18,11,14

Remember those funhouse mirrors, same thing is happening, except it makes you look thinner so you buy it in impulse

Target has a smell, that the associates spray over the floor to remind you of Target

 Don't trust the sizing, every clothing has different models, take your measurements and go by that

Nutella shares the manufacturer as Kirkland's hazelnut spread

Zara has complete vertical integration  

Fashion Nova, Shein, Rainbow, Forever 21, Missguided and many other boutiques share the same manufacturer
