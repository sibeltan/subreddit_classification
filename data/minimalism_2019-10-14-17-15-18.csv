minimalism,Smart phone data over home internet,"I've been thinking of getting rid of my home internet and just using my smart phone for all my internet needs. Everything I do on a laptop I can do on my phone so it makes no sense to have both. If I do need to use my laptop I can either go to the library or use mobile hotspot.

minimalism,My current wardrobe breakdown,"For reference I am a mid 30’s male and live in a true 4 season climate with wild temperature swings and weather conditions. My work wardrobe is casual/business casual.

Currently I own 95 Items - not counting socks + underwear, formal attire ( 5 items) or headwear and gloves (11 items). 

This list is broken down into categories and counts as follows:

T-shirts - 20
Shirts (button down) - 20
Sweaters - 12
Pants - 12
Shorts - 8
Outerwear - 11
Shoes - 12

52% of my wardrobe is black or gray, 18% navy, 12% white, 5% denim and 13% falls into the ‘other’ This category includes other coloured clothing and prints.

The majority of my wardrobe, 63% came from independent men’s retail stores, 12% from brand specific brick and mortar, 11% from major department stores, 4% has been purchased online, 4% from outlet stores, 4% from sporting goods stores and 2% where gifts. 

It would be great to hear how everyone else’s wardrobe breaks down as well",2019-10-14 15:02:02,3,5
minimalism,Getting rid of things and the relief that follows,"I, like many of you, found the idea of minimalism attractive because I have too much *stuff*. Not hoarder-levels-broken-rubbish-piled-in-your-hallway levels of *stuff*, but just enough excess that fitting all of it into the place it belongs is a hideous game of tetris where you have to remember that the rubiks-cube-you-can't-solve and the old sunglasses-box-from-three-years-ago (why do you still have that?) can be stacked on top of one another to fit in the bookshelf which is already sagging under the weight of a load of *stuff* that isn't actually books at all...

&#x200B;

Still with me? Yeah.

&#x200B;

I'd vaguely entertained the idea of minimalism for a while (hello grey t shirt brigade), but not actually managed to get rid of much *stuff.* I'd taken the clothes I never wear, the boots which no longer fit, and the rubiks cube I can't solve, and stowed them away in assortment of plastic bags, suitcases and other annoyingly shaped storage devices over the course of a year, leaving them piled up in the back of a wardrobe. Out of sight, out of mind - or something. I felt better for it. My life was tidier, more organised, and I spent less time looking for that grey t shirt I really like, but which always gets muddled up with those clothes I no longer wear.

&#x200B;

One weekend my girlfriend came to visit. ""Why do you still have that slow cooker?"" (crock pot for my American friends) was the seminal question. I hadn't used the thing for months and didn't even really like the stuff that came out of it - mushy, lacking structure, and generally brown. So I listed it on facebook - ""fantastic crock pot - yours for just £5!"". To say I had buyers biting my arm off would be a slight exaggeration. A week of responding to dead end tyre kickers and eventually a week someone came to pick up the damned thing. It was finally out of my life. So much effort. For £5?!

&#x200B;

At this point I began considering the value of my time. It's finite after all. ""Bill Gates values it more than anything else"" says his PA - ""it's the only thing he can't buy more of"". Why on earth did I waste even 10 minutes, let alone the half an hour I probably spent over the course of the week photographing, listing, and going through the processes of selling a crock pot?! This is where the point of this post dawned on me. Sure the crock pot might be worth £5 to someone, but is it worth £5 to me? Is all the effort required to sell it worth £5 to me? The answer, is unsurprisingly, no.

&#x200B;

And so it was that I carted a whole load of stuff to the charity shop. An oversized sandwich toaster, a rubiks cube that I still couldn't solve, toiletry products from Christmas 2015 that I never did, nor had any intention of using, and a whole heap of clothing that either didn't fit, or I didn't like. Sure I made no money from it, but I gained a whole load of space in my life, and saved an enormous amount of time. The ease of devolving myself of the redistribution responsibility of this *stuff* was mindblowing, and the relief at having it out of my life, instant. Minimalism for me is not just about getting rid of *stuff* that you **don't** enjoy, but making that process spark as **much** joy (sorry; couldn't help it) as possible.",2019-10-14 05:27:59,4,18
minimalism,Discussion: minimalism and keeping collections,"*Disclaimer: the word 'collection’ should be interpreted as a large one for the purpose of this post. I know that this is something highly subjective, but let’s assume 'large’ means more than what you can honestly enjoy, but also, not hoarding tendencies.* 


Some people here will say that if something brings you joy, be it a collection of things, it’s fine, because minimalism means keeping the stuff that makes you happy. While I agree with the stance that if something sparks joy, you shouldn’t toss it for the sake of getting rid of it, I’d want to add that our collections have a tendency to get out of hand or just be unused for a great part. Just like I had with a gigantic cd collection, there are only so many parts of your collection that you will truly 'use’. Collecting art seems fun, but are the pieces presented to their full potential, or are they just cluttering the space / put in a cabinet for no one to see? You could collect stamps and glue them in a scrapbook, but does it make sense to have 10 scrapbooks? In both examples, the collection might have a better effect if kept a bit more minimal. Say, 5 paintings on the wall as opposed to 10 on the wall and 20 more in a cardboard box in the attic; or just a couple of scrapbooks displayed on the coffee table / stored away in the bookcase as opposed to 12 scrapbooks somewhere for no one to see. 


Of course, there's many more things to collect besides stamps and paintings, and some of us use their collections to make a living or practice a hobby (think of photography and having different lenses to work with), but what about all of us that own hundreds of books? What about those collecting merchandising from their favourite sports team? What about 250 cd’s? Can we truly enjoy collections with such proportions? Could it be possible that this is not a 'collection’ we’re keeping, but something we haven’t dealt with yet on our minimalism journey? Could it be that it is, in fact, contradictory to keep collections as a minimalist? 


Another thought: could there be a Pareto optimum with regards to collecting, and is this the point where 'minimalism’ stops? 


I guess my thought on this is: a collection doesn’t necessarily stand in the way of minimalism, but it should be done right. If it’s collecting dust on a shelf or packed away in a box in the garage, then I guess it’s not *really* compatible with minimalism. If it’s not being used or frequently being looked at (and I mean thorough looking, not the kind of looking you do where you don’t really 'register’ what you’re seeing simply because your eyes are used to having those objects there), it might interfere with your minimalism. 


Then of course, you don’t really have to care about any of this. Heck, I don’t even really care if someone thinks I'm not a minimalist because of XYZ. Just wanted to start a discussion here, what do you think about collections?",2019-10-14 04:45:22,4,4

minimalism,"Looking at becoming a minimalist, any tips","Hi All,

Simply, I’m looking at becoming a minimalist.

So I am mostly thinking of becoming a minimalist for two reasons A: Finance reasons and B: It seems to give purpose to things without materialistic value.

I’ll admit, over the last few years I have spent a lot of money on crap, and I suppose starting a minimalist life kicked me out of that but I am looking for more suggestions from minimalists to help me go further.
I have gotten rid of a lot of things that didn’t bring me value, I also found I do a lot less that does no bring me enjoyment, like going out, I don’t go out drinking a lot, its expensive and I don’t really enjoy it.
Gaming is another, its expensive with around £60 a game, and I hardly play games, I have Apple Arcade and even then I think, I’m hardly playing these games.

I know minimalism is a balance, bringing things into your life that are meaningful, that give you enjoyment and value, and discarding the things that don’t.

Anything else you could recommend? I don’t want to go the full route where I ditch my furniture and so on though!

Thanks!!",2019-10-13 13:31:32,4,0
minimalism,How do you handle gifts?,"It was my birthday recently, and it got me thinking about how other folks on this sub handle gift-associated events. My mom is a kind sweet woman who can't accept the idea of not giving physical gifts. It is not worth it to me to fight about it. But I also don't want to just give away whatever I'm gifted. I've come up with some tactics that have worked, and I'm curious if other folks have other ways they approach these events.-Quality replacements. I try to go through my things and find things I want to include in my life in principle, but perhaps not the version I have. Then I ask for items that replace these (usually a quality upgrade). For example, I had these drink coasters I hated but I like having drink coasters. So this birthday I asked for a nicer set. Good to go, family is happy, I'm happy, old coasters were freecycled.-Consumables. I ask for beauty products/skincare items that I will use up and would have purchased on my own (I pick amongst the things I use that are a little more high end, so it can feel more like a gift. Not ""hey winter is coming, can you get me some dry scalp Head and Shoulders?"").

minimalism,Dealing with seasonal hobbies,"Hello folks. If you use to be like me and have a few hobbies which change depending on the season or some weird cycle then please tell me how you deal with the physical aspect of these hobbies.  


**What I mean:**  
I like art. I love sketching and painting with colored pencils, ink, and watercolor.  
Also I like electronics. I have a 4-box big Arduino kit with LEDs, resistors, different modules, and much more.

  
The problem is that I do not do art for more than a couple of months a year. Most of the time its the autumn.  
The same goes for electronics. I like to tinker with them, but the time spent with them is not more than a month in total each year.

Yes, I could sell or donate my art gear and paper and get it when I need, but my inspiration is not infinitely long

And the electronics - I would love to have the space taken by it to be used for other things, but it took me a few months to get all the parts of it and giving it away would really waste the time spent.

minimalism,We sold our car. Using only bicycle and public transportation,"So, we, myself and my daughter Gaia, sold our car yesterday. I am 26, she is 2 and a half. I have been into minimalism for quite some time now. I am not hardcore minimalist, I have some stuff still that I need to get rid off, but I am getting there.

The reason why I sold the car is... well, I really don't need it. I cycle every day. I can do hundreds of km a day if needed. You don't really need a car unless you live in a really rural area imo. We use a good bike and a Thule bike trolley for two children. I use at as an sort of bike trunk as well. I can spend 200 euros in Lidl on food and stuff and can haul it 20km home in it.When it rains, buy a good waterproof jacket, pants, etc. There is no bad weather, just bad clothing.

The car was parked in the same spot since May. And it was the biggest clutter I had in my mind. I am trying to be enviromentaly friendly and just a thought of polluting with a car to go somewhere when I can use a bike was such a burden and I felt guilty even thinking about it.

Even the fact my daughters name was Gaia and driving a car made me feel like a hypocrit.

So I sold it. Bought us some good winter clothing. Soon I am planning to buy an e-bike so I can cover more distances.

minimalism,Opinion: Privacy at the cost of some digital clutter is minimalist,"I value my privacy. That means a little bit of friction is added to using my digital tools. However, the more data we give to the Silicon Valley moguls, the more power that advertisers get. As such, I believe it is minimalist - or at the very least, anti-consumerist - to value privacy at the cost of *some* digital clutter. 

It is easier to be private on the internet than you think. These are my recommended steps: 

1. Use Firefox. It has native content blocking. There are settings to disable tracking, disable cookies, history, etc., depending on your preference. Install and adblocker. 

2. Go into your device's privacy settings and turn off tracking. 

3. Quit social media. It clutters our mind, time, privacy, and robs of our attention. If you need to use social media for important reasons, get it off your phone and schedule your social media time. 

4. Use a secure cloud service. Google Drive, Amazon Cloud, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox can read your data. Their server-side content is encrypted, but your connection is not encrypted. A slightly more secure alternative is iCloud with 2FA enabled, which supports end-to-end encryption but not on the browser. For even more security, there are fully end-to-end encrypted cloud services like sync.com. For guaranteed security, you can host a server yourself with tools like NextCloud (fully open-source and free server hosting) or Resilio Sync (p2p synchronization through bittorrent standard). Be sure to have triple redundancy *minimum* with an off-site backup if you go this route. 

NOTE: Some potential misinformation here. 

5. Use a VPN. It will cost your money. You will be able to watch foreign Neflix content though, so that's a good side benefit.",2019-10-10 10:52:35,6,39
minimalism,New to this sub. Trying to help with my ADHD,"Hi folks,

I’ve been following this sub for a bit and finally decided to join. 
My life has always been a constant mess of messes. I would get in trouble all the time as a kid for having such a mess all the time. 

Over the years, as a young adult, I was looking into things like minimalism nearly a decade ago when I first heard of it because I wanted to get a handle on my stuff. I tried eliminating things but I would always eventually buy more stuff. 

Then I found Marie Kondo a few years ago and was hoping that would help me get a handle on my stuff. I still failed miserably. 

Fast forward to now: I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and based on everything I know and things I’ve heard from other people like me, the constant mess is part of the deal. 

Now that I know what my issue is, and I’m being treated for it, I would like to take a new look at minimalism and try to implement it into my life. 

I’m also in the process of moving and now is the ideal time to set some new rules, get rid of stuff, and start a new path.

minimalism,Favorite high quality basics clothing brands?,"New to this sub, never realized a lot of what people called my ""OCD"" or ""strange habits"" kinda just fit into this general minimalism lifestyle. Since realizing that minimalism is actually a thing, I've been trying to take more steps to move my lifestyle in this direction.

I've looked through other posts but I feel every clothing suggestion post is targeted in its own direction based on who's asking.

One thing I've always preferred to keep minimal is my clothing. I don't love owning a lot of clothing because I always forget to wear stuff.  But I also hate doing laundry frequently, especially because it wears my clothing out. So I want to stock my wardrobe with a good selection of high-quality basics that can be worn throughout most seasons (T shirts, cropped tanks for layering, officewear, jeans, etc).

&#x200B;

Since I'm still relatively young, poor, and impressionable, I've had phases where I want to experiment with my wardrobe and I end up doing hauls from shit quality stores such as Forever 21, Boohoo, Fashion Nova, etc. Never doing this again since I realized I'll wear the things once or twice before they fall apart in the wash.

&#x200B;

To sum up my style, I like being comfortable but also wearing things that are flattering to my build. Sporty chic. Slightly tomboyish. I like basics that are more ""fashionable"" and have unique detailing, if that makes sense. Like interesting stitching or a high quality fabric.

&#x200B;

But I'm trying this new thing where I don't wear my gym clothes everywhere, as I want to start looking a bit more put together day to day. The biggest thing I am particular about is the way pants fit me; I still haven't found a pair of good office pants that have a truly high waisted fit. I'm a 22 y/o F, 5'8, 165 pounds with an athletic build and finding pants is the worst.

Some brands I really love, and why (this list might be more helpful for women)

&#x200B;

**Gymshark** \- Best performance gymwear for the price IMO (haven't tried Lululemon because I can't bite the bullet on spending 90$ on leggings) . I stocked up on their leggings over the course of the last two years and they've all held up great. I haven't been keeping up with their new collections but there's something in the line for everyone. Make sure to air dry and skip fabric softener to prolong the life of any clothing!

**Madewell** \- Only have an item or two from Madewell but I like the overall look/quality of this brand, I just can barely afford it.

**Girlfriend Collective** \- Sustainable and high quality athletic wear, but minimal enough that the pieces can be worn casually. Their fabrics are made out of recycled water bottles and my leggings from GC have held up SO well. These leggings for me personally don't perform the same for my workout style, but they're on the thicker side so I'll wear these casually with outfits.

**American Apparel (lol)** \- Love the look of the brand. Wore it almost exclusively in high school. The quality def went down after Gildan bought them, but if there are other brands that have a similar look I'd love to check them out.

**Herschel** \- Not a clothing brand, but I love the look of all their bags and luggage. My wallet, carry on suitcase, and daily carry bag are Herschel and the quality is great.

**American Eagle** \- Good stuff, love their Soft and Sexy tshirt line. A lot of the pieces I've had since high school are still in my regular wardrobe rotation. Stuff is pretty affordable when it's on sale too. Only brand of jeans I've had luck with.

**Reformation -** LOVE their style. Can't afford anything so I can't speak on the quality but I'm waiting for the day I can justify spending 300 on a dress.

**Topshop -** Again, love the look but can't really afford anything. Also, similar to reformation, they mostly utilize thin models so it puts me off, makes me think their clothes won't fit me correctly.

minimalism,"Pairing down closet, opinions/help?","This might just be me, but I struggle pairing down my closet. I have a lot of clothes and I want to reduce the clutter but I feel like throwing away and donating is selling myself short but with eBay the turn time of a 7 day listing feels inconvenient, days to pull and store the item somewhere and then a week to wait and if it sells to ship. And the only consignment shop near doesn’t really value some of the more fashionable items I would like to sell.

minimalism,I need help with my relationship with clothes in general,"So, right now I have about 10 or 15 tops and 3 pairs of jeans. My jeans are always fine, but I have this problem with tops. I keep trying to curate pieces that “spark joy” in me, and they do for a little while, but a few weeks later I’m already bored stiff of them. So I donate them, and get something new to replace them at the thrift shop.


Cycle continues... love them at first but then I get bored of them and can’t stand them anymore, so I donate, etc....This even happens with my basic pieces. 


I’ll have a plain white shirt, which is supposed to be a foundation versatile piece, and I will wear it a couple times but then I’ll get rid of it because it doesn’t drape enough, I don’t like the bottom hem, it’s not the right SHADE of white, the sleeves are an inch too short, the material is too heavy, or too thin, etc... 


So I’m constantly looking at my wardrobe not loving anything, and constantly feeling like I have “nothing to wear”. I’m also the kind of person who chooses my outfits based on my mood. So sometimes I’ll get a top that suits one mood, but then I’ll be in the opposite mood on a purging day and get rid of that thing, and go get something that suits my new mood. But then that mood changes, I’m sick of my clothes, yadda yadda yadda... what the hell is going on here? Any help?

Now this is really personal but for me 7 days is optimal and less may be survivable but cons like constant hand washing of clothes and grocery shopping were not making me a happy guy. For some it might be 10 or 14 or 5 might be perfect for you but not I.

My parents have been on a similar journey with me and my other two older siblings have other priorities, but as a family we have decided to do Secret Santa for Christmas (where we get something that the person specifically requests), for birthdays the other two siblings take the birthday sibling out for a meal and all other holidays are non consumerist. 

My friends think this is kinda cool but don’t really adhere to a minimalist approach.

My birthday has just been and my beautiful friends gifted me beautiful pots with plants I don’t yet have, which adds to something I get a lot of joy from. Another friend got me a 2020 diary/planner in the same style as I used this year which I have loved. 
My boyfriend gave me flowers and wrote some beautiful words.

I intended to tell my friends not to get me anything, as I was worried about being given “stuff” that I would have held onto for a little while before inevitably needing to be donated or given away, and instead I got some really meaningful, wholesome (and functional) gifts that I can use and enjoy.

minimalism,Computer desk for geeks playing with minimalism.,"Dear minimalist I'm a total geek and thats why some people sometimes say that my desk looks like a space ship control center lol 

Anyway since I started my journey with minimalism  I've been having nothing but fun. I have digitalized all my documents, pictures, books and currently the only one left is my passport, so no problem here :) 

Next step was my wardrobe and that was even easier, I used some of advises from you here and I left only that clothing that is the most comfortable to wear and makes to most sense - I ""upgraded"" from 100+ items to \~40 so I call it a success!

The time came to take care of my desk and the problems starts here... First of all getting rid of the stuff probably not gonna happen any time soon as in my mind I have already absolute minimum that take the whole space on my 70"" sit stand desk lol. Well I figured that since I can not get rid of the stuff then I'll at least try to declutter and organize shit out of it!

So the plan is organize cables that are laying on the floor like horde of snakes and to do that I planning to use something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Privacy-Management-Organizer-Sleeve/dp/B07D1HGXDG/ref=pd_cp_23_1/141-3294212-3036569?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07D1HGXDG&pd_rd_r=432ff7af-ae3d-4429-9a19-e939a6f049f7&pd_rd_w=LXctU&pd_rd_wg=znayx&pf_rd_p=ef4dc990-a9ca-4945-ae0b-f8d549198ed6&pf_rd_r=F4NAPJQA168942M2Q8XY&psc=1&refRID=F4NAPJQA168942M2Q8XY#customerReviews) or [this](https://www.amazon.com/StandDesk-Cord-Taco-Management-Productivity/dp/B077F53754/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=under%2Bdesk%2Bcable%2Bmesh&qid=1570383122&sr=8-3&th=1) \- but I figured since they are using some type of cloth to make these, then as well I can try to make something like that myself. Just not sure what type of material would be the best since it has to be flammable resistant, any ideas? maybe cotton bed sheet?

Second part of the plan is to take all the possible items laying on the top of the desk and move/install then under the desk <eureka> The items I decided to move: headphones(already done it and I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MG3TQ2X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1), pretty cool because it has that little space to strap a wire or small earbuds), audio interface(thinking to use velcro tape for that or similar or a some kind of tray), MacBook(definitely needs to be on some kind secure tray, but no specific idea yet...?), keyboard and mouse(natural choice here is to use sliding keyboard tray, so I already tested [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0773TDLHG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) tray and I don't like it as it looks kinda weird - sticks out little bit, plus it's not stable and slides out not that great. Next one on test list is mount like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Under-Keyboard-Install-Undermount-Management/dp/B07Q5WKXN8/ref=sr_1_9?crid=1AP3PMDZMJXP4&keywords=keyboard+tray+under+desk&qid=1570385602&s=office-products&sprefix=keyboard+%2Coffice-products%2C167&sr=1-9) or similar unless you can recommend something better? Before mounting it I was thinking of using EZ Anchors so I can remove the mount without loosing too much the mounting wholes). 

Any other pointers for me?

On one hand, I’d absolutely like to be sufficiently prepared in case of a possible emergency (blackouts, public utilities malfunction, natural disaster, etc). But, at the same time, I prefer to not hoard things, and spend time, money, and space for those things.

My mind feels overwhelmed when I think about to how approach this. How many days should I prepare for? What comforts can I let go of during the situation? Should I aim for 2 gallons per day instead of 3 in an emergency so I have to buy and store less water? Should I buy canned beans, or would I be better spending the money on things like peanut butter and coconut oil, which pack more calories in a smaller package? What should my communication set up be like? Who am I even supposed to even communicate with?

And a hundred other similar questions keep my mind spinning. I almost with I didn’t read too much into prepping to begin with.

After a year or so I had a look again under my bed and found the books I had totally forgotten about. I didnt even think once about them and the whole story came back into my mind. The minimalism area in my brain was born but I didnt knew what it was back then. So I figured I dont need these books and I looked around my room and found more stuff I will never use in my life again. Also I figured I dont need these ENDLESS AMOUNT OF STORAGE AREAS IN MY TINY ROOM. Every time I cleaned up my room I felt like I had so much more space. I wanted that space! I lived that space.

One other thing that I refuse to spend money on is more storage items. You can buy bins and bins and fill them with all your junk, but not buying these things forces you to either use what you have, get rid of what you have, or buy less overall.

minimalism,How to clean out an inherited house and the associated items in a sensible way?," I inherited a house with two households as unfortunately both my Mum and Grandma passed away this year. It's a hard time for me and I am struggeling on what to do with the house as well as the household items. As I was raised in this house, I prefer not to sell it, but will try to rent it. Moving in myself is no option atm, as my job is located about two hours away.

Before I rent the house, I need to clean it out. How can I deal with the items in a frugal, sensible and minimalistic way? Any recommendations or experiences from fellow redditors? 

There are so many towels, bed linens, tableware, dish towels, decorations, clothes etc. that would last me a long, long time without having to buy new stuff. But I live in a shared flat and don't have endless space to store everything until I need it in the future. Plus, some of the items are very oldfashioned and I don't like them. But does it matter? They are already there and I could save a lot of money if I use them. I know I can't keep everything, but it also doesn't make sense to throw stuff away and then buy it new within the next months / years. 

I am wondering if I should remodel one of the cellar rooms to store things until I need them? Paying money for renting additional storage space doesn't make sense imho.

Thanks for reading, I am looking forward for some advice.",2019-10-05 07:58:38,27,90
minimalism,"[Decluttering] I spent three days tidying up, these are some of my thoughts and future plans. Thank you guys for inspiring this!","So, as a sort of culmination of my studying of minimalism I have been tidying up a lot these last days, like a lot. It all started on Thursday, where I had a day off as I was not called in to work as a substitute teacher. Normally this would mean sleeping in, but as I lay there in my bed just staring at this massive mess of stuff that I have been accumulating over the last nineteen years, I decided to do something about it. It started small, I put all the stuff that was still functional into a box for the thrift store, and all the trash into a large trash bag. It quickly turned into two boxes, then three, then four, and as I still live at home I had the advantage of being able to just put it all on my dad’s trailer, which really is just a waiting room for stuff that is going to be thrown out or brought to the thrift store eventually. Then came Friday, and once again I was not called into work. I did not even think about getting back into bed, instead I immediately picked it up where I left Thursday, and all the stuff that I could not bring myself to throwing out the day before quickly found its way into bags and boxes. During the tidying I started experiencing all sorts of emotions, and as I made my way through old toys, old clothes, festival wristbands, childhood photos and all sorts of documents from high school I felt a lot of things, nostalgia certainly being one of them. Yet, relief was by far the largest. As I took photos of the things that awoke memories and put the things in the thrift store box, I knew that they had brought me joy, but also that they were now on their way to bringing the joy that they had given me into someone else’s lives. Today, Saturday, I feel like I am around ninety percent done, and I am really satisfied with myself. I can find the things I need in an instant, and as an example, instead of sorting through fifty pens, I can grab the one that I know will work every time. 

I feel like a big part of minimalism is self-reflection, the ability to think about the emotional value that we assign to stuff, which often ends up being more of an obstacle in the way to mental clarity than anything else. And while the nostalgia of digging through old stuff is great, I am certain that I can feel that looking at a photo of the thing, too. 

I assume the next big step is digital minimalism. I have already sort of started this by deleting Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat from my phone, but as I tidied up I found tons of old disks, thumb drives and even some harddrives inside old computers, from which I am going to export all of the things worth keeping, and sorting them to be kept on one drive. To me, at least for now, I do not feel that the road to mental clarity is to get rid of all my digital memories, but rather to keep them organized in a place where they are easily accessible, all while taking up no more space than a couple of gigabytes on my google drive. 

If you made it all the way through, thank you! I believe this is the start of an amazing journey, which was ignited by you guys on r/minimalism, Matt D’avella and Nathaniel Drew.

TL;DR I went on a tidying frenzy, which made me feel all sorts of stuff, but mainly proud of myself.",2019-10-05 06:59:02,10,141

minimalism,Things I Can't Minimize,"I already know some of the responses some of you are already preparing to write, but hear me out first.

I get the appeal of minimalism. I grew up with Baby Boomer parents who themselves were the children of people who lived through The Great Depression. It was all about stuff. Stuff that you would need ""someday"" or ""if it ever comes up."" It was also about the dream life of the big house, multiple cars, 2.5 kids, the little picket fence, and so on. But I don't like excess or clutter. I like things neat, tidy, and organized. I also find the idea of having ""the extra bedroom"" just being a storage unit is absurd.

However. There are some things I enjoy. I am an avid reader and writer and have close to 1,000 books in my home. Some of them are current bestsellers, some are classics, some are just personal favorites, and some are rare and valuable books that I was gifted or managed to find for a good price. These books mean a lot to me.

Then, there's the cookware. Pots, pans, spoons, dippers, knives. My wife and I both cook and we enjoy cooking. It's something we do together as a couple. We cook dinner together usually 4 or 5 nights a week, and then there's of course the leftovers. We only eat out once per week, and that's on Saturday mornings when we go to a favorite local restaurant and have breakfast. There's also a park a few miles away that we go to and walk through after we eat. It's a weekend tradition since we've been married.

So, I guess what I'm saying is, I don't have to feel guilty about enjoying things and having actual possessions in my home and having things that I enjoy using. I know it's a stereotype, but I always feel like some people in the movement are always judging you, and acting like you aren't a real minimalist if you do something else than sit on the floor staring at blank walls.",2019-10-03 06:37:24,11,24
minimalism,Floor sleeping - room needed?,"Hello,

I want to move to a bigger flat. In my fantasy world I would have many many rooms but obviously that is expensive.

The goal is to be able to have a room in my home for professional consulting as a psychotherapist.

I came across the idea of floor sleeping a while ago and have been thinking about it since, especially considering I have posture issues.

My question is whether people who floor sleep (either in countries where it is customary or not) have an actual bedroom or do it in the living room of their home. This would make it possible for me to move into a 2 rooms flat and use the bigger room as living room with dining table, computer, sofa and the supposed roll-up mattress for floor sleeping, and the other room to consult.

I am really not knowledgable on the subject of floor sleeping so any advice is welcome.

minimalism,Minimalist Camping Trip Essentials,"Ever since becoming more minimal, I think more intentionally about everything including what to pack for a trip.

minimalism,"Minimalists, how do you store and organize your stuff?","I own little compared to most, but the things that I do have are not very organized. So, good on the application of minimalism, not so go on the aesthetics of minimalism.

Everything is disorganized.

Examples:

The 2 dozen books I own, half sit in a plastic container in the closet, other half on my desk. I don’t have a dedicated book shelf. I’d rather not buy one because the living quarters are somewhat small.

I have a 3 tier shelf. Top shelf has my hygiene products (shaving, deodorant, toothbrush, etc). Middle has cleaning products (laundry soap, cleaner solution, dish soap, etc). Bottom has a small box of hand tools (screwdrivers, pliers, etc) and electronic/electrical things (cords, spare bulbs, etc).

Similarly, in the closet, I have various things besides clothing. Daily use backpack, duffle bag, paper towels, moving supplies (I move every 3-5 years).

So, almost all the things I own are used, but are not organized.

I’ve spent money on buying various containers in the past to separate the various categories, but it didn’t work out. I had the containers stacked on top of each other and it became a pain to unstack and get to the bottom container for something. I ended up giving the containers away and consolidating everything on the 3 tier shelf.

Now I’m considering shallow containers I can slide under the bed.

My mental block in buying expensive furniture to display my belongings is because of moving. When I move, I prefer to do the least amount of packing and unpacking necessary. I’d like the things I access everyday to also be easily packable and transportable.

I’m also considering a small drawer unit. I’d store the bulk of nick nacks and things in there and just tape it shut when it’s time to move.

Any suggestions?",2019-10-02 17:47:13,3,4

minimalism,My kitchen setup,"I love to cook as a hobby so maybe this list is a bit extensive for some of you, but I don't mind having so much kitchen stuff as it's something that brings happiness in my life. 

However, I thought this guide might be helpful to some of you trying to reduce the amount of kitchen equipment you may have (disclaimer: i am vegetarian so if you like meat there are probably a few items you may need)

Pots and pans: all you need is a wok! The Chinese peasantry for thousands of years have used the wok exclusively for hundreds of years. Want to pan fry or saute? it can be done in a wok! boil some noodles or rice? just put lots of water in a wok! steam? same thing just put a steam basket on top! Additionally, chopsticks are used for stirring and removing and adding ingredients to the wok, as well as eating. Pretty much one utensil and one container is used for all aspects of eating and cooking. Now of course, I own a cast iron and a rice cooker but that is more of an ease of use and flavor thing. A pure minimalist not that interested in cooking that much could just use a simple wok. 

Glassware: I know it's a tad bit hipsterish but i use mason jars. It works as a coffee mug (i have lots of coffee stuff too but that's another enjoyment of life thing that is a bit unnecessary) and a normal drinking glass, but the primary reason I use mason jars is because I make my own salsa (i love salsa) and hummus (I love hummus) as well as canning and jarring fruits, pickling, storing spices, and whatever else. There is a million things you can do with a mason jar. Sometimes I even use them for portioning veggies or spices when I am prepping for a meal. If you know the cook time for different veggies, it's easy to just throw them into groups (in a mason jar) and then add different jars at different times. At any given moment I probably have 48 different jars in rotation around my kitchen. I will add I have wine glasses as well but that's just another thing I want to be able to enjoy so it isnt essential to the kitchen

Plates bowls and silverware: For plates and bowls I more or less just use what normal people use. Sets of 10. Silverware, as aforementioned I just use chopsticks, forks and some spoons. I have 5 sets.

Knives: Never buy a knife block. You will never use half of the knives. I have a knife roll with ONE really nice chef knife, a parring knife for smaller fruits and veggies where a massive knife doesnt make much sense, a bread knife (I like to bake bread lol), and a filet knife (for fish). Most people probably just need the chef knife and the parring knife. I would also recommend a honing rod and a whet stone set

Misc: A scale, mixing bowls, a mandolin, im probably forgetting some stuff but thats essentially everything I have",2019-10-02 12:56:07,6,12

minimalism,UPDATE on Day 31: Day 3 of wearing the same outfit to work. Growing skeptical of people judging me.,"Original Post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/cz5me2/day\_3\_of\_wearing\_the\_same\_outfit\_to\_work\_growing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/cz5me2/day_3_of_wearing_the_same_outfit_to_work_growing/)

So exactly 31 days ago; I made a decision, out of nowhere, to start wearing the same thing to work every day. It was a black t-shirt and black kick boot trousers. I chose this because it was comfortable. After 3 days of wearing the same thing to work; I grew skeptical of people judging me and turned to this community. A lot of you told me that instead of wearing the same thing and making a drastic change; I should opt for few more outfits to work. And this is what I followed. Instead of going extreme and making a drastic change I stayed on the moderate change track; I scrounged my cupboard for the outfits that I was most comfortable with. I ended up selecting 4 more tops (bought 2 new that served what I was looking for), and bought one more pair of similar trousers in a navy color. I chose 2 pairs of shoes to rotate. In total I have now 5 tops, 2 pants and 2 pairs of shoes; a total of 20 outfits! And can I tell you a secret? I have only been rotating 4 tops out of them and they are more than enough, I dont need the 5th one, so I'm gonna go return it this week. And I taught myself that it's not about being stingy, it's just about owning what you like and use.

No one has noticed that I have been wearing the same thing or have said anything about it. Hell, I havent noticed myself and do not feel any monotony when it comes to my clothes to work. Every outfit I have is comfortable and functional. I figured if I am going to spend 8 hours at work, it better feel like pyjamas but look like suits. I will soon post an album of the outfits on r/femalefashionadvice/.

Thank you so much everyone for making me realize the importance of this change and giving me the right guidance. May be if I would have just picked one outfit and gotten extreme, I would be back to my old habits in a week. Now I look forward to every morning, I look forward to the outfit I'm gonna wear tomorrow (I never thought that could happen considering I wear them every other day). And I take care of these clothes because I know they work hard for me. More importantly I have been successful in clearing two kinds of clutter: no more clutter in my cupboard trying to put together a new outfit each day; and no more clutter in my head trying to pick an outfit every morning, earlier I would sometimes start thinking about it the night before, seeing if they needed ironing. I picked my current work outfits with a no-ironing policy.

I'm super happy and just want to keep the momentum going. I really really hope I do not give this up 2 months down the lane. If I do, only I will be the one at the losing end. Just today, I saw one of my colleagues wearing a really cute trendy outfit. I always notice her clothes, since she wears super nice clothes and I was previously a clothing fan too. But I have learnt to appreciate it on other people and every time such a thought comes to my mind I remind myself of the annoyance and frustration it had caused me.  I still have other fav trendy outfits in my closet but they are only reserved for weekend or when I'm going out; if I'm working, any other outfit except my work clothes need to be out of my way.

Thank you everyone for coming to my ted talk. No, but seriously thank YOU.

That was the topic of the last post. This post is about the appreciation of the change of lifestyle that I've made and the impact it has had on my life and head space, and more importantly inspiring others to do the same.

minimalism,I really love thrift store shopping. It really brings me joy. But I don’t always like the results of having too many clothes.,"Okay, I love second hand clothes shopping. It brings me joy. I think I’m really talented at finding very nice clothes at the thrift store! It’s benefitted my life a lot. I can work less and still look great!

However, here is the issue. I love thrift shopping for clothes as a hobby way more than I need clothes. I’ve thought about turning it into a business. But I don’t have space to make this into a business and even the idea of accumulating more items in order to liquidate them is just. Stressful. For a minimalist. 

I’ve been selling things in small quantities to resale boutiques for years and made a small cut of the money. It’s nice because I don’t have to have the items around cluttering up my life. But it’s sad to see how much more money they make reselling the items they bought from me. Sometimes (a lot) I just give a very nice item to loved ones who (sincerely) appreciate it.

Thoughts? Should I just continue selling to resale boutiques? Should I just find a new hobby? 

For context, it’s all about the cool and unique clothes I find when thrifting. It’s a hobby. I don’t find myself having a shopping issue when considering any other categories in my life (new clothes, housewares, etc).",2019-10-02 10:22:57,5,2

From the Article 

>It’s that time of the year when a fresh start means reducing the clutter accumulated in the last 12 months and in the many months and years before. The sagging bookshelf and the piles of books under the tables and around the bed might be a good place to start.

>How do we decide what to cull and what to keep? We asked some authors and the owner of the Strand book store for advice.

minimalism,"""Does it give you joy?"" - yes, but not all the time. What to do?","I'm in the process of making some tough decisions.  I have items I want to be rid of (I think) but at the same time I can't let go.

Using the Kondo methodology I ask myself, 'does it bring me joy?'.  Yes, but I can't remember the last time I picked up said items to use them.  The rest of the time they do not.

So Kondo's method doesn't work for me in this example.  Not that I follow her 'teachings' but I know a lot of people here do.

When I (rarely) use one of the items I'm considering to put in the 'toss it' pile, it fulfils a purpose,  but I tire of it quickly and it could be months before I'll pick it up again.  That makes it really hard to make a firm decision (I've tried selling some stuff several times only to chicken out).  It's almost like a 'just in case' kind of justification and I'm having a hard time nudging it to a firmly keep or firmly toss side.

Any advice?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your replies.  With your help, I managed to decide it goes in the toss pile (well, sell it off on eBay anyway).  Sometimes there are things that we don't know how to deal with, and you put things in perspective to help me make a decision.  I'm sure it's the right one personally.  It'll just mean some changes to my life going forwards, which I'm looking at with positivity (not an easy thing for me though).",2019-10-02 03:06:34,14,25

minimalism,Minimalism is for passionate workaholics,"This is just something I feel from reading a ton of stuff about minimalism. I've read books, articles, watched YouTube videos, and documentaries... It always seems like it's made for ultra-busy people. Don't get me wrong, I love minimalism, I love the idea of it and I love applying anything I can to my life. But most content about minimalism talks about ""working too much"" and ""making space in your life for your passions"".

I'm kind of a lazy person, and by that I mean that it's really difficult for me to *get* to work. Once I'm on it, I'm very productive. But I'm definitely not a workaholic. I have plenty of time during my week to practice my passions. But what passions? I often end up tired at the end of the day, watching Netflix, unable to do anything creative, struggling to find the courage to even make dinner.

I like being a minimalist because my brain is always working at full speed. Trying to find new things to simplify in my life gives me something to satisfy my brain's hunger for more thoughts, while soothing my mind by eliminating physical clutter that usually makes my brain go even crazier.

But I'm not a passionate workaholic. I don't have a creative passion I want to make time for. I don't work too much. I don't need to make space in my life for the things that matter. 

In fact, I wish there were more things that mattered in my life I would want to make space for.

minimalism,Help wanted: Methods for letting go of items,"First time poster, I like this community and I would love some advice!

I've had it kinda sprung on me that I'm going to need to move apartments in a month (I live on a university campus). 

I won't go into my situation too much, but I don't have a perfect relationship with my family, so when I moved here, I brought everything I owned with me (as I no longer have a room at my parents' place).   
I didn't really have a choice in the matter: everything I've ever owned got taken here with me when I left home.

For this reason, I have... SO much stuff, in my little campus flat room. It's *everything I own*: all my books, all my clothes, all my collectibles, my gaming consoles, everything.   
I am, unfortunately, a collector, and it shows. My room is very nice and very tastefully organised, but it has a lot of stuff in it, and the idea of moving it all is already a nightmare before I've begun.

I was hoping I wouldn't have to move this summer, but at the most, I would have prolonged it till next summer, when I plan to move interstate after graduation. So regardless, there's no way I can take all this with me. I need to drastically cut down on what I own, and probably fairly quickly. 

**My biggest problems are:**   
\- Expensive items (it *really* burns to get rid of something that cost a fair amount of money, even if I don't like it nor use it. I have some expensive dresses, as an example, that my mother talked me into buying, that I never wear and don't really want to.)  
\- Collectible items (figurines, etc)   
\- DECORATIVE ITEMS. I have the unfortunate habit of keeping a lot of things I *like* (posters, cutouts, magnets, decorative items) that have no functional use and, while they look good, are little more than clutter. The KonMari method is useless for me because of this; decorative items spark joy for me even if they're utterly useless junk I'd honestly be better without keeping. I'm a decorator, I like having shelves and surfaces to display things on. 

It sounds drastic, but I want to get rid of literally like half of what I own. I really crave the freedom of being able to move relatively hassle-free on short notice, without having to wrangle the logistics of eighty boxes of crap. 

If anyone has some methods for going through and getting rid of things, or good things to remember to help sever the connection to useless items, I'd love to hear them. 

To give you an idea what I mean by a decorator, here's the more cluttered side of my room;  [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/628307303048675328/628323532811665424/JPEG\_20191001\_061255.jpg?width=901&height=676](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/628307303048675328/628323532811665424/JPEG_20191001_061255.jpg?width=901&height=676) 

I guess I want to change my mentality a little, away from that of a collector/decorator. While I love how things look and I love having things that look nice, it's not practical nor healthy to have a mindset so focused on material, physical things and how they're arranged. 

Thanks in advance if anyone has any tips and I apologise if this isn't allowed. I think it's okay as I've seen posts of a similar type but please feel free to delete if not.",2019-10-01 15:15:37,35,14

Let's for example say I invest a certain amount of time solving an issue once and for all (like getting a really nice garbage bin, or figuring out an automated way to run a specific computer task, or having a daily uniform, or even a consistent meal plan). I always assume that this is on the path of minimalism: that once I figure out a particular issue/solution that I'll have more time and energy to focus on other things.

But in reality I feel like other aspects of my life end up taking over that 'empty space' or 'free time' and I'm not actually left with the feeling that I have plenty of time or energy at the end of my days.

In some ways this is exactly what minimalism helps with, the ability to focus our lives around what is important to us.

For example, toolkit, leftover picture frames, extra charging cables, desk resupplying like Staples, rubber bands, paperclips, or even like extra blankets that will be used for colder times or guests. Where is a great place or great way to store this stuff without having just one big bin off to the side with seemingly random objects in it?

I don't want to put all my desk supplies resupplying stuff on my desk and I don't want to leave the blankets everywhere random I might want a blanket, and I don't wanna leave a bunch of random cables in the walls, so what should I do with them? 

Getting rid of them doesn't seem like the best option since most of them are ""just in case"" items that j actually might need (not keeping for emotional value). Would love to hear tips on this",2019-09-29 08:03:43,18,19
minimalism,decluttering and sentimental value,"Hey there, reddit.  
Recently, I've started to declutter my house, as I've gone from a 3-person household to a 1-person household in the same space. I used to live in this house with my grandparents, who owned quite an amount of things, especially lots of small items. Many of these items were very dear to them, some also very expensive, and I'm having a hard time figuring out what to part with and what to keep - I've decided to keep at least a few small things to remember them by (not very minimalist, I know, but they hold some value to me as well), but I have an incredibly hard time bringing myself to throw out some stuff I know was important to them, but that I simply have no use for and also can't rehome because, frankly, it's just useless in general.

minimalism,Freeing My Space,"Something I’ve been meaning to do for a long time is free up my space. I live in a loft apartment, and when I moved in after college it became obvious how much I had, contrary to my pride in my budding minimalism.

Yesterday I cleaned out and donated/trashed/sold  five bags of clothes and shoes, a bookshelf, misc garbage, and more.
For the first time in my life, I don’t have to push down the clothes in my dresser to shut the drawers, and the “goal” clothes I have saved fit nicely in a box instead of taking up half my wardrobe.

Most of the things I was keeping were perfectly good (and unused). I’d bought them for the aesthetic, or they were bought for me, but they just didn’t fit in with my life. I’ve figured out that I’m susceptible to both “this was a gift” and “this is still good” to the point that I’ve lived with unused goods for upwards of a decade in some cases.

Waking up this morning and seeing it all fresh just made me so happy, and cemented my move into progressively more minimalist ways. It’s also more encouraging that, when I move again, I won’t have to haul around quite so much stuff!

minimalism,How do you arrange minimalism with sustainability?,"I'm slowly transitioning into a more minimalistic lifestyle right now, which obviously comes with clearing out things I don't really need or bring me joy anymore.

I keep facing a dilemma in this process. When I know I want to throw something away, my thought is always ""Maybe I should keep it, I bet I could upcycle this somehow"" (Especially with clothing). So I sometimes end up keeping something with the thought that I can use it as e.g  a cleaning rag later, so when I do need new ones. And I end up with T-Shirts, saving them for a later environmentally-friendly use, essentially continuing to clutter my life. 

Of course donating or selling is an option, but I'm talking things that are just totally used or of no value.

I have no idea how to go about this. Of course minimalism means less buying stuff, having stuff, thus less garbage. But in the process of still cleaning out and getting rid of stuff, have you encountered similar thoughts? Or went just straight to the point and threw out old stuff?",2019-09-28 00:13:08,11,21

minimalism,Any advice for a tough living situation?,"••• 
This is an extremely lengthy post, but I promise it has everything to do with minimalism. Bear with me. 
•••

So.

I'm a 20 year old (just had my birthday a week ago 🎉) from rural Wisconsin. Last year, I decided to make a decision that changed my life. I moved to New York City immediately after graduating from high school to go to a college in the center of, arguably, the most ""cluttered city"" in America.

About half a year before my move, I met another Wisconsinite high schooler through Facebook (hereinafter referred to as Max) - we were both part of our college's ""graduating class of..."" page. We were the same age, and we were both looking to pursue the same major.

Max, at that time a perfect stranger, asked me if I was interested in getting an apartment instead of dorming, as dorming eliminated any chance of obtaining in-state tuition. I agreed to think about it; Hey, why not? I like to think I'm an easy-going, highly adaptive individual.

So, I spent the next several months getting to know Max. We're getting along. We have the same sense of humor. We're looking at NYC apartments and agree to fly out a month before to find a permanent place while staying at an airBnB. We bonded intensely and quickly because we were both making intense life adjustments in a place we had no clue how to navigate.

Fast-forward: Max and I have a 2 bedroom apartment in Uptown Manhattan, NY. I'm a ""hardcore"" minimalist. One of those that counts his possessions and strives to comfortably live with as little as possible. I only own black, grey, and white clothing. My phone is completely themed black and white - you know, the whole deal. So, my room is practically a blank slate. I'm IN LOVE with this room. A bed, nightstand and closet. Everything clean and in its place, accounted for. 

Things are great. College classes have started. On the first day, Max and I meet another guy (now, my best friend - practically family), hereinafter, Harrison. 

Harrison is dorming (bad move, Harrison). He hates it; his roommate is loud, irresponsible, and messy. We love Harrison, so he practically moves in to our two-bedroom. Harrison sleeps on our garbage futon 5-6 days out of the week. Max and Harrison make jokes at my minimalistic lifestyle, but they respect it and understand it. We all agree that we'll get a 3 bedroom next year...

Fast-forward: It's the end of Spring Semester. It's been nearly a year, and our lease is almost up. I'm out of state for an internship. Harrison is using my pristine room with my permission. We've terminated the lease early to get a headstart on the move. I even bust my butt to help sell it to the prospective tenant

Approximately 3 weeks pass, and Max spontaneously announces that he will be joining the military. He won't be living with us next year, at least not for more than a few months.

This changes everything. We now have to purge our list of 3 bedroom apartments and start looking for what we already had. Okay - don't panic - it's inconvenient, but I'm easy going and adaptable; We'll find a better 2 bedroom. Make lemonade out of lemons.

So, that's what we do. We agree that Max won't sign the lease, that essentially Harrison will take his place in the new apartment. Max won't pay more rent than Harrison did. Fair. Deal.

So we find a place. Solid location, good size, similar price. Max talks to the broker about getting put on the lease... Interesting... That's not what we agreed on, but whatever, he's our good friend. I've lived with him for a year with little problems. I'm thinking he just wants to dot i's and cross t's. Sure.

The dynamic of our trio shifted around this time. Harrison and I felt Max was rushing this military decision. We also felt a deeply upset about Max's poor communication which caused us to make a relatively unneeded move in NYC.

Fast-forward to now: Max has decided NOT to join the military. In fact, since he's on the lease, he plans to stay for the whole year.

The arithmetic went like this: he'll be paying a third, so he needs to be in a room. I have the least furniture and possessions, so I literally have no choice but to room with the highest denominator to reduce the maximum level of discomfort. Unfortunately, Max owns the most, so I'll be rooming with him.

Max doesn't clean, doesn't communicate, and has an increasingly irritating attitude. He has never apologized for any of this behavior nor has he apologized for putting us in this ridiculous position.

• • • • • • • • • • • •

HERE is where I need advice specifically from r/minimalism.

I room with Max in the bigger room. Harrison has his own room. Both of my roommates own more than I do, which is understansable, but Max owns objectively too much. He has random untouched trinkets stuffed on his dresser, piles of clothes that I've never seen him wear (some even with the tags still on), boxes stacked on boxes to hold his desk, computer, and other random stuff. Max practically owns 90% of our shared closet and 90% of our shared floorspace.

This setup looks like me with a bed and Max with the rest of the room. MUCH different from my beautiful, empty room in Uptown Manhattan.

To say the least, I'm starting to feel less easygoing and adaptable. I'm not happy with how I'm living, and none of the blame is mine for the situation.

What do I do? Max is here for the year. I don't want to make his attitude worse than it already is, but I cannot stand being taken advantage of for my minimalistic lifestyle and personality.

I put some stuff in the basket and took some stuff out. I picked things up and put them down. I kept finding myself thinking, “That’s so cute! I want it!” Pause. “But do I need it? How will I use it? How will this serve me? How will it function? Will this be in my next declutter?”  The answer was yes to all but one $2 item. Although, upon further reflection I probably shouldn’t have gotten the $2 item either. 

I also found myself having the feeling that I could admire an item and then move on. This was the biggest win for me. I am seeing that my mind shift is happening. My thoughts and outlook is changing to fit my needs. I am looking at value and quality over quantity. 

I have been working and practicing to be more minimal in all aspects of my life and today I felt the fruits of my labor. It felt good.

minimalism,My relatives are using me to justify purchases,"My grandparents and other relatives are getting up there in years, and their mindset has turned from ""I want to have nice stuff"" to ""I want to have nice stuff for my family to inherit"".

Let me put it out there that they can do what they want with their money (they are not rich, they are barely making ends meet) and I don't care about an inheritance. I'm not sure I should say something or whether that would even do anything because they seem like they aren't in touch with reality most of the time. I am just tired of being used to justify these purchases and I bet they are running themselves into the ground doing this for all of their grand children. 


Both sides of my family do this and I'm worried that funerals and times of grieving are going to be overshadowed with the stress of figuring out what to do with life size porcelain dolls and huge jewelry pieces.

minimalism,Finally decluttered,"I’ve collected things my entire life, whether it was pokémon cards, video games, clothing, vinyl figures, shoes, CDs/DVDs, and the list goes on & on. I have always been obsessive with loving something, and then buying multiples of said item. What i realized is that the satisfaction was never met; and although the purchase was enjoyable, it always left me wanting more. Not sure what type of void i was trying to fill. 

One collection that has surpassed any time/fad and age, has been shoes. I have collected shoes since the 7th grade, buying/selling/trading. As a matter fact, I somehow ended up with over 200 pairs of shoes at one point in my life. Over 80% of the collection unworn. Over the past few months, i’ve been using ebay, facebook marketplace,& reddit to finally rid of the shoes i have not worn in the past 6 months. I have finally gotten down to less than 10 pairs(i know, not a “minimalist” amount but impressive nonetheless). I also took about 4 garbage bags full of clothing to Plato’s closet and donated the rest.

I don’t think i’ll ever be a true minimalist; I still enjoy for one, fashion and I have learned to limit myself to a few quality brands that stand behind their product: Lululemon, Patagonia, Nike, & J Crew . I still enjoy quality things,& spend a lot of time looking for BIFL items. However, I’m way more conscious in what i decide to purchase now. and I don’t have an obsessive collecting disorder anymore and 90% of the time i try to limit myself to one item that i know will last me for a long time  (1 hydroflask, 1 backpack, 1 belt, 1 wallet, 1 hat, 1 Cast Iron, etc.) Definitely learned that quality > quantity any day, and although my items still don’t fit into a back of a truck, it is nice to not need a separate storage unit for sneakers. 

This has somehow given me more time, to do what i love, and something that i have been passionate about for the past few years. Bodybuilding. and although it requires a few quality items (Belt, wraps, lifting shoes, etc.) It all gets tucked away into a gym bag at the end of the day! 

This is just me rambling, and sharing my thoughts. Either way, i’m glad i ran into the world of minimalism. It has definitely changed my outlook on life, and the necessity of certain things, and what brings me joy. thanks for reading.",2019-09-23 01:21:06,8,133
minimalism,Thinking about furniture free living in my first place.,"I am living in a dorm style living situation right now. That means, I can't remove ANY of the furniture. After I'm done in a few months. I am going to get into my first apartment. Really excited cause, it's my own little space to call home. 

I just don't want any furniture. My idea was to get a Japanese futon to sleep on. Then for a couch, I was thinking a few memory foam dog beds or something. That's conferrable/ergonomic. 

Then for a dress, I was just going to use my closet with a few nice wooden hangers. I thought about purchasing some night stands, I just don't think I'll use it. 

Also instead of a lamp. I'm going to get those glow and the dark stars that hang on the ceiling. It will be more then enough light for me. Plus I'm going to hang Christmas lights around my apartment to save money on electricity. 

If you haven't figured it out already. I'm a extreme minimalist/frugal individual. I have a saying ""If it doesn't bring meaning in my life then screw it! It's not stepping into my house!"" Yeah kind of blunt right! Well that's my personality. 😂 

My hobbies/interests are Movies/TV shows, gaming, anime, and technology. I also have a a interest in architectural design and am going to college for it in January. I can't wait 😊 other then that, I live in a colder climate so the minimalist wardrobe doesn't work for me. 

Need to have two types of clothing winter & summer. I do have a a rule for clothing. Don't cheap out on clothing they'll last longer that way. Lastly always buy second hand, it's cheaper in most cases.",2019-09-23 01:02:14,15,5
minimalism,A Possible Strategy For Weeding out Reddit?,"Reddit is great, but I've found myself too many times putting away reddit on my laptop to pull up reddit on my phone. Especially r/All, its so addicting to find new videos, interesting content, and hella dope memes.

So I looked for a particular strategy. Instead of using Reddit as my one and only, I've been testing replacing subreddits with the websites I used to go to. 9to5Mac for r/Apple, Engadget for Technology, Apple News for current events, etc. While they tend to update much less frequently, and I am less likely to fall into repetitive circle, all the while probably improving the quality of content I am around, I am uncertain if this strategy will work.

minimalism,Minimalism and Depression,"Hey all, first post here.

Back in 2015 I was super depressed and ran across a guy on YouTube by the name ""Thriving Minimalist"" and watched a video where he did an apartment tour. He had (basically) nothing except the essentials. Long story short, I loved it. I was living with my grandmother at the time as I was still in college and I took EVERYTHING out of my room except for my bed on the floor, my xbox, and tv. No dresser, no lampstand, no entertainment center. Only 3 things in my room. 

I felt so free and relaxed, my mind was actually kinda clear.

Fast forward to now, my (former) best friend and I are renting a house and my depression has torn our friendship apart.

I don't know if it's the clutter that is making me depressed or what, but I'm constantly miserable. 

I have a lot more stuff in my room than I use to, and my roommate isn't minimalist by any means whatsoever, which is fine with me, I can see why people wouldn't wanna do minimalism.

But it's taking a toll on my mental health, I'm constantly depressed and can't think straight. 

There's probably a deeper reason than clutter, but clutter certainly makes it worse.

I guess the point of this post is to ask how you get back into a minimalist/stoic lifestyle after you've been out of it for so long.

Thank you for reading.",2019-09-21 09:07:54,10,20

minimalism,The evolution of an Amazon Wishlist,"This struck me today and I wanted to share...

I used to love Amazon. I loved it. I loved making an order, pruning the order, adding to it, finding new things that would *""enhance my life""*. Often I would buy things **just to buy them**, and I had the debt to show for it. I bought jewelry I never wore, games I never played, clothes that didn't fit, books I didn't read. I consumed because it was easy and cheap and convenient and made me feel excited in a way that other things in my life failed to at the time.

But then I grew. I grew up and grew as a person. I embraced stoicism and minimalism and simple living. I got rid of the things that I felt had to define me because *that's just how the world works*, and started to define myself actively instead of passively. Now I own the things that are useful and personal and donated the rest. My space is simple and clean and quiet. It's still coming together, but I'm happy with it. 

I was joking around with someone about Amazon Wishlists recently, and I was struck by a sudden urge to revisit mine for the first time in almost two years. I got rid of my Amazon account for ethical reasons after being a member for ~8 years or so, plus my more simple and intentional lifestyle means I almost never visit the site anymore. I pulled up my old list and was was shocked. I recognized the items that were in there, but I'm no longer the same person who curated such a wasteful and ridiculous list of *garbage*. Stuffed animals (I'm 30), ugly jewelry, paperweights, clog shoes with bee patterns, impractical novelty backpacks. What the hell was I thinking? 

It was a shock to me to realize that none of these things that I wanted so bad before held anything even resembling an interest to me now. In fact, if somebody offered me these things *for free* I would still be like, *nah I'm good*. The mental shift that you experience when you work on improving your outlook on life feels really intangible, but it's a nice reminder to see the result of it in a somewhat quantifiable way. 

But yeah. Minimalism is great. Intentional living is great. Fuck Amazon and consumerism. It's a false god that keeps us complacent and lethargic and constantly craving more.",2019-09-21 08:22:11,30,376

minimalism,I have the feeling technology is becoming less and less minimalist and more dysfunctional,"Maybe it's an occupational bias (I design and build software for a living) but I have the feeling that technology in recent years has been piling things on, instead of looking to clean things up and make them more functional for people.

It seems to me that both hardware and software (apps) constantly add new features, but without cleaning up the old crud, and it all just seems so cluttered. It's just much easier to add new things, than to think about re-designing to preserve ease of use.

I'm an app developer myself, yet a lot of the apps I've tried feel so complicated to me, with so many hidden settings, circular logic, multiple screens, colours and what not.

I often feel outright stupid for not being able to use them (other people rate them highly). It reminds me of the days of the old Windows operating system, where you could go around in circles trying to change something simple about your screen settings.

minimalism,Consumerism & Minimalism - Discussion,"Hey guys,

So recently I've been getting into Minimalism a lot, and have cut down on a lot of things in my life that I deemed unnecessary. I've thoroughly enjoyed the process and it has actually helped me with lots of other areas of my life too, such as fitness. However, I have been aware of a few things. Nowadays, I cannot go on any social media site or web page without receiving ads for 'minimalist items'. These items range from backpacks (so many) to wallets to desks, and many more. It seems to be that many companies have tried to capitalize of the modern popularity of the movement. The formula for the products will generally be: 1) supposedly high quality or obscure material 2) supposedly very good functionality, 3) hefty price tag. There will be many many copies of these, all with that same minimalist look.

The issue with this is that it makes minimalism not an activity of getting rid of stuff in your life, but an activity of acquiring more stuff under the guide of simplification. Someone could just be using a regular backpack that suits their needs perfectly, but will instead pay $150+ for a sleek looking bag. This isn't what minimalism is about. I find that a few youtube channels also promote this style of minimalism, although this is more of a grey area.

I wanted to ask what you guys thought about this, and if you have been experiencing the same thoughts or even getting the same sort of ads. I know ads are targeted these days, I just wanted to see if anyone was thinking along the same lines.",2019-09-17 17:18:04,12,4

minimalism,Is time minimalism a thing?,Is it possible to prioritize minimizing time spent doing chores by having more stuff? You still want to be minimalist but the goal is to minimize time doing chores/unmeaningful activities. For example I used to do laundry every 3 weeks because  I didn't have laundry machine in my apartment and had more clothes so that I can overall spend less time doing laundry. Another example is having a bigger kitchen so you can leave commonly used appliances on the counter while still having enough space to prepare food so I don't have to put stuff away every time I use it.,2019-09-17 05:28:00,40,144

minimalism,Minimalism: Ease Versus Peace,"So this is an issue I struggle with, especially with regard to technology. I'd love to hear some of this subreddit's thoughts and feelings about it.

The issue is: ease versus peace. Allow me to explain.

I have a job in the tech arena, so I need to be able to write software for any number of platforms. To that end, the MacBook Pro is the ideal ""full computer"" for me. It can run, easily and efficiently, macOS, Windows, and Linux. That much is decided. It's from there that I struggle.

Do I want an iPad that I can read books on, play games on, browse the web, check e-mail, organize my calendar and contacts, and more? The iPad makes everything easy and is VERY capable. Or would it be better to go to an e-ink Kindle? It'd introduce some friction with doing anything other than reading, and perhaps that'd introduce more peace, knowing I can only read books and have to use the ""Experimental Browser"" to do things like get the forecast, check the news, etc. I could then use my Switch for a dedicated gaming device since I very much enjoy quick and fun games.

Do I want an iPhone with similar functionality? Or do I want a basic phone that will limit my options?

Do I want an Apple Watch or do I want a simple solar-powered watch that is set by the atomic clock radio in Colorado?

I go back and forth on this a lot and... I've landed on the Apple vertical for its integration and keeping my number of items to a minimum, and having it all in one place makes it easy and the Apple Watch caps it off by keeping my phone in my pocket or in my car's center console nearly all the time, and Reddit is the only ""social network"" I am a part of.

Whenever I go all-in and unpack the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch and move in the basic items, I find myself occasionally needing the functions they enable so I have to hotspot the phone, pull out the MacBook Pro, and get to work. But maybe that friction is good?

For me, I think the Apple route is better, and I'm selling my other stuff, but... I get to questioning myself sometimes. The idea of that simpler life where I have the Kindle out and nobody from work can get ahold of me is so appealing. Then reality sets in and shatters that idea.

See... I go back and forth. Which is ""better,"" in your opinion? To have things easy (in my case the Apple vertical), or to have things peaceful (Kindle / Switch / basic watch). Or whatever similar dichotomies there may be for you.

Thanks!",2019-09-16 18:16:33,8,6
minimalism,Do any of you have conflicts with your significant others who don't want to live simply?,"
I've always been the kind of person who easily lets go of things I don't need and use.  I love living in small spaces, and I enjoy sorting through my possessions, to ensure that I only have things in my life that I either love or need.  But my beloved boyfriend doesn't see any reason to get rid of anything!  He admits that it's annoying how our apartment is crowded and cluttered, but he doesn't think it's enough of a problem to make a change.  He has boxes of things that have sat in the same place for two years, and he doesn't even know what's in them.  He says he doesn't see any problem with that. 

I respect his right to do whatever he wants with his personal belongings, but I do feel frustrated that he won't even consider donating some of our shared stuff.  We have stacks of dishes and cheap tupperware we never use, and he wants to keep every one of them.  Last year, I bought a nice set of coasters for our coffee table, but we ended up only using one for each of us, and the other four have never moved from the center of the table.  I knew he would throw a fit if I said I didn't want the extras, so I hid them away in a cabinet he never looks in, along with some knick knacks, and waited to see if he would notice.  It took about a month, but he did notice they were gone, and he wants to keep them. 

I have considered ""accidentally"" breaking things, just to have a reason to get them out of the house.  This seems extreme and wasteful, but I'm so frustrated, and I don't know what to do.  Can anyone here relate?  How do you cope?  Any tips for trying to find compromise?  Should I just let it go, and accept our cluttered home? 

TL;DR: My BF is not interested in downsizing our unused stuff, even though he agrees our house is too cluttered.",2019-09-16 15:07:58,19,26

minimalism,"Minimalism, the past and mental health.","I've been decluttering for hours - it started as a way to distract my mind yet I found myself reconsidering all these materials in my place and what they mean to me, why I chose to keep them in the first place. This is kind of a loop activity for me if I have a certain type of anxiety, the source of which I cant put my finger on.

These materials vary from little rocks I collected from all the beaches I've been to, to the little letters or sketches I did in a highschool notebook while bored in a classroom, from a binder full of journals to do-not-forget-about-me gifts.

It led me to think about the past years and what I mentally collected of all these experiences. Laying out all these materials on the floor (which I've gone through and declutter many times to this degree) paints me a picture. A picture of what I chose to keep to myself, why and what I thought of while holding onto these materials. These things. These objects. What value they had for me, what they actually represented to me.

The picture is an absolute bittersweetness. 

Just a whole pack of moments: almost happy, yet always overshadowed by sadness. The ones I still remember crystal clear to this day. 

This is nothing but a snapshot of how I viewed myself or my moments, my pieces of reality back then. How it was so hard for me to truly grab the happiness in those moments with some heavy depression & anxiety to deal with. It's still a struggle but i feel the progress within me.

A true change stars with realizations. Minimalism and its philosophy of making conscious choices helped me tremendously - by making me lay everything out and take these snapshots at things or objects, then the invisible meanings they had for me, then how these meanings were formed by the very values shaped by experiences. It led me to take a long look at my history, my chocies and the nature of the consciousness behind them. And I think the real change lies right there. In any realizations that can possibly come into the light afterwards.


If you're still reading - thank you. I just wanted to share my aspect of minimalism and how it has strong connections with mental health for me, in the way how it pushes me to lay things out and look at the things (i.e. little representations of a past reality). I hope it does the same level of good for you too.

minimalism,Becoming more minimalist II,"[So I made a post a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/d19tjb/minimalism_is_taming_my_anxiety/) about how minimalism is working a treat in my life- I am 17!. I made some more moves today, and I really feel like I have achieved something. Being more minimalist has really helped me; I have been able to focus on school, save a LOT of money (four digits in the bank, from washing pans in a restaurant kitchen & selling stuff no longer of use to me), and channel all of my energy into few passions instead of many.

**I am now 12 days into my gaming detox.** I was addicted, I believe. No, I never spent more than two hours playing in a day, but I began to play games and not enjoy them... But instead of taking a break, I kept playing. Reading into it, this is normal- I have grown out of videogames, but my mind has not grown out of the dopamine rush it receives from playing them. Currently, nothing appeals to me other than videogames, as all skills take hard work and determination to develop. Games abuse the brain with rewards, and it makes it ever so increasingly harder to enjoy other activities when no such constant reward system exists. Originally, I decided to quit gaming temporarily and then play in moderation. But I recently came to the realisation that time isn't the problem- videogames are. 

**I put my PS4 in the attic.** I am not prepared to sell it, and I would probably be happier making someone else very happy and giving it to them for free. Maybe when I move house in the next few months, I will put it in the lounge to use as a entertainment hub. Seriously, for the price I paid, it would sting to sell it for so little. But the main part is, it is out of my sight. I can never be tempted to play. 

**When I went to put my PS4 into the attic, I also moved other stuff I don't use currently up there.** Even odd things like cables and boxes- each little thing which doesn't serve me purpose will gradually be thrown out or replaced out of sight until I require it. I also rearranged all of my drawers in my desk and bedside table, just to make it a little bit neater until I move house and give myself a bigger project :) 

**I have worked hard in ensuring I procrastinate as little as I possibly can on the internet.** Firstly, all apps which are not essential have been deleted from my phone. This started with social media, last post. Well, today I deleted YouTube. I will only watch YouTube on my desktop- and I have blocked recommended videos from appearing with a chrome extension! This helps me stay away from gaming videos, AND helps me stop clicking and clicking and losing much of the precious time we have. 

**In my next house, my bedroom will be completely minimalist.** Right now, I have posters on each wall, which i cannot exactly remove right now. As potential buyers are coming to view this house next week, the posters hide the marks on the walls etc. But I am going to just have plain white walls, perhaps with some very minimalist artwork or album covers framed on the wall. I will have no shelf with gimmicky gaming collectables- just a bed, a desk (with no rubbish on- just the essential), a wardrobe and a bedside table. Oh, and my guitars. I would like to have these on display so I am more motivated to play!

So right now, I am studying my college subjects, commuting to college on my bike,  listening to music and podcasts, and gradually playing more and more guitar. It is hard to stay motivated with the guitar, for reasons mentioned above regarding videogames. But, I am progressing. Eventually, I will enjoy it again. I also wish to make one more habit when the time is convenient: reading before bed, instead of going on my phone!

I used it for traveling, going to concerts, eating in restaurants and generally doing something other than staying at home with my few items.

Something that generates a lot of stress for folks on our sub is the idea of permanently committing to the minimalist changes we all find ourselves seeking.

I'd like to invite those of you who feel that way to *try experiments in minimalism*.

Instead of selling or donating an item if you're feeling resistance, try allocating those things, digital or otherwise, away from your life in a ""this doesn't have to be gone forever"" pile.

Live that experiment and see how it feels, then determine if it's right for you.

Some example experiments that aren't at all permanent that I've done recently:

1. Forgoing shampoo completely
2. Downsizing the available kitchenware in our house to the minimal required for my partner and I
3. Putting all the shirts that are ""I might ..."" into a different storage area
4. Digitizing documents but keeping them elsewhere
5. Putting all my books in storage
6. Switching from many plastic items to fewer metal, glass, and ceramic items
7. Quit facebook
8. Quit the majority of reddit subs I follow (now at 3)

My results

1. So far way better, although there's an adjustment period
2. Our drying rack is far less overloaded, my partner now cleans her dish(!) instead of reaching for a new one, and I do less cleaning and feel less stress at home.  When guests come over we pull out the extras.
3. Donating them
4. Kept only a few documents where the physical writing inspires me, especially as those people age and eventually I lose them
5. I kept all my books!  I love them; now I see them as art and enjoy them more than any art I'd owned before
6. I feel better knowing I'm not scraping plastic into my salad and focus more on minimizing total plastic use overall
7. Zero change, never used it, now I'm just more secure digitally
8. Not missing a thing, in fact feeling liberated as I can get to reddit ""zero""

I completely understand that this isn't any different than ""put it in a storage locker and after a year, ditch it"" from a practical perspective, but this shift in mindset has made it easier for me to be ""ruthless"" with my minimalism in a way that would've been much harder without.

I wanted to offer this gentler mindset to new and old members of our community alike.  It's been a tremendous asset as I continue to refine what matters most to me in my life.

Hope this helps one or two of you out there!",2019-09-13 16:58:10,5,92

minimalism,"Minimalism Is Much More Than Decluttering, Purging, & Organizing","The minimalist movement often focuses on the physical aspect, but there is a strong connection with the digital and mental space.

At its core, minimalism is about being thoughtful and intentional about what we let into our lives, so we can focus more on the things that matter most.

Just like how a cluttered and messy house can be a major distraction. When our physical/digital space is a wreck it shouldn’t be a surprise that it could affect our mental space.

It’s about your psychological relationship with what you have, that matters.

minimalism,How to achieve a balance between taking care of your items vs your items owning you,"So since I became a minimalist, I've learned to really value the items that I do decide to keep, and to take better care of them. 

For example, after I replaced a worn pair of sneakers for new ones, I also purchased a spray cleaner for the white sole that was sold in the same store. Kind of an impulse purchase, but I do use it to clean my shoes and I like it! 

But at what point do my items stop serving me, and I start serving them? I ask because I've read about how keeping your phone plugged in for too long past the fully charged point will damage the battery, like charging overnight while you sleep. My phone is currently plugged in and I want to sleep, but I don't want to leave my phone plugged in all night, nor do I want to wake up in a couple hours just to unplug it, nor do I want to unplug it before it's had a chance to fully charge. 

In this instance, I will probably either just leave it plugged in overnight or unplug it soon before I sleep because getting up in the middle of the night to unplug it seems unreasonable. 

But at what point does me taking care of my possessions move into I'm-letting-my-stuff-control-my-life territory? Thoughts?",2019-09-10 22:53:27,19,8

minimalism,We sold everything we own! We did it! We sold our house!,"A few years ago, hubby and I ventured to Hawaii, and went out with a realtor looking at yurts, properties, etc., and he was offered a job on the island. Only problem was that we had four dogs at the time and couldn't do it. So, we have spent the last three years preparing to excuse ourselves from the rat race. We owned a house as well, and we had to start somewhere. So, we moved from upstairs to downstairs, which left us three empty bedrooms, and a bathroom upstairs. We emptied them. We emptied the basement, reduced our items, clothing and junk. Got rid of every single decorative item, knick knacks, jewelry, dvds, appliancces, housewares, etc. It culminated in a big garage sale and we sold everything that we just didn't need and couldn't take with us.  Two of the oldest of our dogs have passed in the last two years, we have two left, one is 13 (I hope she makes it another year!!) and one is 3 years old. 

My hubby got a job as a traveling medical professional, and we will be moving from state to state every three months, for the next 24 months. We will be living in short term rentals, which come with housewares and furniture, and/or living in hotels, which is what we are doing now. He gets a stipend to pay for the hotels. 

Truth be told, we designated four personal storage bins each, and four community property, for a total of 12 bins that would fit in the back of our truck. 12 bins was too many, since regrouping, we have realized how many bins we haven't even looked in, after doing this for a month already. We have so much more to get rid of. This has been an eye opening experience, realizing that I really need SO LITTLE!!! I need my laptop, my headset, my printer, my clothing, my toiletries, and not much else. The hotel supplies everything I need, down to toilet paper and dish detergent and coffee... even breakfast is included! 

I can't tell you how amazing this feels. I have two drawers here with clothes, and my closet is empty. My husband thought he couldn't do it, and I was worried, he was always a pack rat. But we went to the  bank to open a savings account (WOW!!!!) and they gave us a pile of paperwork that he was going to take home, and I said Honey we don't need that everything is online, just leave it here. And he did. No more piles of paperwork and no more junk. I bit the bullet and got rid of so much stuff. I would say 90% of our belongings. We digitized all photos and videos and paperwork over the last year in preparation.

I still had my luggage on board and don't have to worry about it. Only thing is we have a 7kg (15lbs) weight limit. 

So here is the ideas and I'd appreciate any creative ideas you have! Pls post links. 

Idea 1: 
1 winter jacket (I need one that is easily foldable, and water proof, but keeps you warm in cold weather) 
3 -4 socks 
2 bras (or maybe even 1..) 
Portable washing bag 
3 pants 
Not sure how many shirts uhg :/ 
Laptop,phone, camera + chargers (electronic bag) 

Idea 2: 
1 winter jacket 
Arrive in clothes ill be wearing and leave my suitcase or bag with no clothes and buy clothes there. I only got this idea because since it's Japan and Korea, I'd like to get a [few] clothes there as a souvenir and than just give away clothes I have back home. 

Idk what do you think??

minimalism,5 Habits I Gave Up As A Minimalist,"The past 2 years has been quite an enlightening road to self discovery for me. 

I started making intentional living a daily focus, and even before discovering the term ""minimalism"" I began adding minimalist practices into my life.

Usually people talk about new habits they put into practice.

I think it's equally important to focus intentionally on \*taking away\* habits in our life as well that don't serve us.

([This video](https://youtu.be/cqS9j0ntXOk) goes into much more detail about the reasons and explanations for the changes that have been made)

But the list breaks down into the following habits I gave up. I no longer...

1. Buy bottled water
2. Purchase physical books
3. Use cash
4. Buy clothing for brand only
5. Eating 3-4 meals a day 

These are all habits I've mindlessly followed doing for most of my life for various reasons (some had good reasons) but I found they didn't serve me and I have felt much better since giving them up, in place of much better habits.

I'm not one of those people that live under this ""minimalist"" umbrella. I simply apply philosophies to my life that I deem beneficial and try not to associate myself to closely with labels.

Thought I'd share my realization and changes with you all in case it inspires you in some way.

minimalism,The 3 33 challenge,"Hey guys
I'm not that completely new to minimalism but since my boyfriend passed 4 months ago and I am about to move, now is the perfect time to get serious.
I'm attempting something like a packing party but what was surprisingly freeing and great was the 3 33 challenge.

I heard about it in the Minimalism - live a meaningful life documentary by The Minimalists Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus. A woman was so overwhelmed by her clothes, she decided to only wear 33 items within the next 3 months (not counting underwear).
So, I packed my whole closest in a box and only left 33 items. It feels amazing and 33 items are more than I thought.

Also, I put like 2 or 3 items in that I haven't worn in like forever but would really like to... Now that I don't have so much stuff to choose from I have worn them both in the last week!
I don't pressure myself to keep this 33 items exactly the same, for example where I live it was hot the past week but will be really really cold in the next month or so, so I'll change like my summer dress for a winter jacked or something.

I hope you got an inspiration from it, and maybe you try it too!

minimalism,Minimalism is taming my Anxiety.,"I am new to minimalism but I decided to pick up on it because I suffer anxiety which is seriously affecting the quality of my daily life. I stress about money (I am 17 and my Father is broke), and I stress about time- primarily, how I choose to spend it. I have spent my whole summer panicking about how I spend my free time, which, rather ironically, prevented me from doing something useful. But I am starting college tomorrow, and I am about to find routine and order for once.

I used to enjoy videogames, but they began to ruin my life. Even though I was no addict, I would constantly sit and stress about how I should be doing something more productive, rather than relaxing and taking the videogame in.

From here, I made my first change.

 **I boxed up my PS4 and I will sell it to somebody. I gave my steam account with dozens and dozens of games, to one of my cousins who is new to gaming.** I am a little disheartened by the money I spent on this hobby and the money I have lost by giving away the account and selling the console at a loss, but I try to look onward. 

Of course, everyone needs a hobby similar to gaming to unwind after a long day. But this doesn't have to be watching TV, or playing videogames, or something similar. When I have enough willpower and order to do so, I will start to read books as a passtime for when other commitments are done for the day. 

I was also upset to never wake up to anyone messaging me, or seeing how I was. Furthermore, seeing other people having such a blast whilst I sat alone in my room, upset me. 

**I deleted all forms of social media.** Instagram and Snapchat were purged some weeks ago, and Facebook joined them this week. I have not looked back.

In terms of belongings, **I racked up every electronic I own but never use, and took them down to my local cash exchange store.** Again, the loss on money is a bit of a sting, although the de-clutter felt great.

And going forward, I am going to work on throwing out something in my room which serves no use to me, every chance I get. I will make a pile of things I no longer need, and sell them/give them away every opportunity I get. 

I am a flawed human being, and I am not perfect. I still suffer bad habits, such as picking up my phone when I wake up, instead of reading a book. I still take hot, comfortable showers, instead of the recommended cold showers. I still procrastinate the internet, instead of making sure all my time on the web serves a purpose. 

In no means am I anxiety-free. In fact, I suffer badly from symptoms of depression too, but the health service here in the U.K. is dreadful. 

So going forward; I wish to tackle my A-levels (starting college tomorrow) with small bursts of revision, play guitar for at a little while each day, go on bicycle rides when the weather is nice, and listen to music in between.",2019-09-08 04:34:18,35,295

minimalism,Minimalisms in name only,"The objective of this post is to differentiate between Minimalism and other philosophies that have a similar appearance.  Minimalism is the philosophy o reducing superflousness. Eliminate all that is not useful. Not eliminate all that is useful and then some things that were useful with them and hope the final product still works.  

Primitiveness is not minimalism. The objective of minimalism is not to execute a regression on function or form in a piece but to sublimate them both by giving them precedence over add-ons.  Primitiveness occurs when you downgrade somthing. Minimalism outright refuses the downgrade but accepts and approves the eliminations of the superfluous.

Minimalism also has a subtle difference with frugalism. While minimalism seeks to eliminate all that has no function, frugalism seeks to eliminate waste. Minimalism is more conceptual and philosophical, with its considerations of usefulness and utility . Frugalism more practical and political, with its rejection of consumerism and traditional descriptions of wealth.

This is tangled with the reason why minimalism is achieved better by a destructive method than by a creative one. It is much better to start with a incredible redundant piece or a cluttered room and remove from them elements than it is to plan for every contingency and making/acquiring just what you need.  Therefore minimalism is identified with a destructive process and other philosophies who can share the process are confused with it.

False minimalism can occur when, in the excitation of simplifying life or a work, one eliminates more than necessary or deprives theirselves of genuinely useful things.",2019-09-07 10:45:00,6,13

minimalism,Minimalist's guide to Credit?,"For the longest time, I've been wary of the credit/banking system because I've always associated it with consumerism and extra unnecessary stress. The thing is, there is a way to get hundreds of dollars in cash rewards, free flights, and free hotels without getting into credit card debt. As a minimalist, the last thing I wanted was debt and extra clutter, so I created a system that only requires 20-30 minutes a month, and so far, I've earned over $2000 cash and enough flight points to roundtrip anywhere in the world for free. Absolutely 0 credit card debt and 0 stress.

Here's a list of things you should know before starting this:

1. DO NOT spend more. Be an anti-consumer; the whole point of rewards and points is to get you to spend more.. don't fall for this.
2. Keep your credit card usage at 0. This is achieved by paying off cards fully every week ideally.
3. Do not try to max out points. Play the long game, it's less stressful.
4. I live in the US; I'm not sure how it works on other countries but I'm sure there are helpful resources out there.

The process I'm about to describe is called ""churning"" and its been around for a while. The only thing I'm really giving here is a minimalist twist to it for those who care about living simply and reducing ""mental clutter.""

Before you start this process, you should have a rudimentary understanding of the credit system and credit scores. Just read [nerdwallet.com](https://nerdwallet.com) and you will be good. Get your credit score to at least 690 or ""good"" status before starting. Raising your score is very easy if you are patient.

Here is the algorithm:

1. Search cards that offer Sign-up bonuses. (Ex: get $300 or 30,000 miles for every $1000 spent)
2. Make sure your credit score is good enough for the card and apply
3. Use card for purchases you would make regardless of the card (DO NOT spend more than you would without the card)
4. Pay off the card every week until you reach the required amount for the bonus. Keep usage at 0 (this means you pay it off before it counts as credit card usage)
5. Redeem rewards
6. Repeat

\*Credit score dips every time you apply for a new card, so apply again when you raise your score again. A good rate is 1 card per month.

This whole process takes me in total like 30 minutes a month and I've been doing this for a little less than a year now. It's such an effortless way of making extra money and getting free flights. I don't feel any mental clutter and I can continue to live simply. I'm planning on visiting Argentina to hike in Patagonia this December and I've got free flights plus hotel thanks to this.

I read konmari books & then purge a lot of my stuffs (mostly cloth, shoes, & books). Then, I read ""Goodbye things"" & I really want to become a minimalist. I read those books almost 1.5 years ago. 

I don't know I will become a minimalist one day. I know everyone defines minimalist differently, but I am at a point where I can't let go of things. I think I am at that ""spark & joy"" stage where everything I own spark joys, but I feel like I still have a lot of stuffs I should let go. 

Some of the stuffs, I like to look at, but I don't use them. So, to me, I should let these go because of no function. 

Some of the stuffs, there are memories attached to them.

Some of the stuffs, I can't do anything with like expensive jewelry that my mom and relatives gave to me as gifts. I can't resell these because they will be pissed if they find out. & I will feel very bad. 

Some of the stuffs, I don't use but will need them in the future. Like high heel shoes. I don't wear them everyday, but I wear them for events. I don't ""need"" them, but. There is always a but.

Some of the stuffs, I can't donate/remove until my husband agrees to it because they are ""our"" stuffs. So, there are some stuffs I can't do anything with. One time, we had to discuss like an hour to donate some kitchen items (like two pots, set of plates, & three mugs?). Also, I couldn't donate three of my books because my husband wanted to read them. His argument, ""I donated the books, and he picked them up so now they are his books. So, why should I care?""  I don't want to fight over three books. So, those books are still here after 1.5 years. & he still hasn't read them because he is so busy.

minimalism,"College storage unit causing family conflict—unsure of whether to ""purge""","Hm, this is my first Reddit post ever, I'm really needing some help, and this might be unnecessarily long, so bear with me.

My life is going swimmingly. I graduated college in May, and moved to a new city for what I thought would be a temporary internship. My new room is super tiny (I'm talking only room for a twin bed and a few shelves tiny) so I only brought the absolute essentials. Everything has its place and I keep it extremely tidy. In the past few months I've only needed to purchase one or two things. I've been an admirer of minimalism for years, so I've finally felt like I could *properly* live out a lifestyle I love. I love all my things that I have in my little room, and I don't want to add or subtract anything to it. It's mine.

Come the end of the summer, my internship has turned into my full-time dream job and my sublease turned into a year-long lease! Both great things!

The catcher is, I have a storage unit full of things from college in my parents' city. 4-5 large pieces of furniture, tons of kitchenware, dishware, books, clothing, shoes, tons of miscellaneous ""sentimental"" items. The funny thing is I can hardly even remember what's in it, aside from the furniture, obviously. I've joked with my dad several times to just auction it off so I never have to think about it again, and I'm seriously considering that. My parents can afford the unit, and the unit itself is fairly small, but 100 bucks a month is a lot in my eyes and I feel supremely guilty just knowing there's so much shit sitting in that money pit. (I also don't feel like a ""true"" minimalist knowing it's there, but that's just my ego speaking, I guess.)

My mom, however, absolutely despises the idea of getting rid of any of it. She's a very materialistic woman, and admittedly spent WAY too much money on the furniture that was in my various apartments through college. She's a big spender and a big gift giver. She doesn't want to sell ANY of the furniture as it was expensive and she thinks they are pieces I should have throughout my whole life. I don't love them, I see them as overpriced, unoriginal, and quite flashy. There's no room to keep them in my parents' house, either, as there's enough furniture everywhere, and a garage absolutely packed to the brim of unused things.

I am also worried that digging through the boxes of miscellaneous college things will spark my sentimental side and that I will want to keep a bunch of stuff that I haven't actually thought about for a second this summer. I have a tooooon of old physical projects. If I do want to keep these things, I won't even have room for them in my tiny room, so they'd just be in my designated room in my parents' house, and the same guilt remains. See what I'm saying?

Sorry, I know this is an essay and I probably shared way too many details—I could just really use some clarity that isn't in the form of my biased parents who never agree with one another. This storage unit has caused a ton of arguments during my short time off before I start my job full-time. Thanks in advance, all, I'll take any advice at this point!

Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.""

Edward Bernays, Propaganda

Most of us have heard of Sigmund Freud, few of us have heard of his nephew Edward Bernays. Edward Bernays used Sigmund Freud's newfound knowledge of the human mind to create Public Relations. Before Bernays, people bought things because they needed them. Things were advertised as being sturdy and well built. After Bernays, advertising tapped into the hidden insecurities of the masses. Bernays was the puppet master of 20th century consumerism. Bernays used multiple techniques at the same time to get Americans to buy products.

From Wikipedia

Bernays worked with Procter & Gamble for Ivory-brand bar soap. The campaign successfully convinced people that Ivory soap was medically superior to other soaps. He also promoted soap through sculpting contests and floating contests because the soap floated better than competing products.


Bernays used his uncle Sigmund Freud's ideas to help convince the public, among other things, that bacon and eggs was the true all-American breakfast.


In the 1930s, his Dixie Cup campaign was designed to convince consumers that only disposable cups were sanitary by linking the imagery of an overflowing cup with subliminal images of vaginas and venereal disease.

...

In 1934, Bernays was asked to deal with women's apparent reluctance to buy Lucky Strikes because their green and red package clashed with standard female fashions. When Bernays suggested changing the package to a neutral color, Hill refused, saying that he had already spent millions advertising the package. Bernays then endeavored to make green a fashionable color.

The centerpiece of his efforts was the Green Ball, a social event at the Waldorf Astoria, hosted by Narcissa Cox Vanderlip. The pretext for the ball and its unnamed underwriter was that proceeds would go to charity. Famous society women would attend wearing green dresses. Manufacturers and retailers of clothing and accessories were advised of the excitement growing around the color green. Intellectuals were enlisted to give highbrow talks on the theme of green. Before the ball had actually taken place, newspapers and magazines (encouraged in various ways by Bernays's office) had latched on to the idea that green was all the rage.

minimalism,What would be left of you if someone took away everyone you know and everything you own? - My favourite (and the hardest!) minimalist question to ask myself,"This is one of [**the 5 crucial questions**](https://medium.com/@juliahorvath/these-are-the-5-questions-you-need-to-ask-yourself-to-gain-a-deep-insight-into-your-own-personality-bff2ef323dc?sk=085704302c2bc3e8c178e0f739b24e20) I regularly ask myself to gain a deeper insight into who I am and what I want and to stay on track with my life and goals.

It is always the one of all questions and prompts that I find hands down the most difficult to answer - especially the people-part. I'm okay with losing things but to define myself completely without any external factors whatsoever like my friends or partner is hard. At the same time it's also the question that gives me the highest clarity about myself, so I wanted to pass it on here with the hope that answering it will help many of you.

**What would be left of you if someone took away everyone you know and everything you own?**

Looking forward to lots of inspiring answers.

If you have more questions like this that help you stay on track and true to yourself, I'd be more than happy to hear them!

minimalism,Capsule wardrobe setup and failing at minimalism,"One thing I am doing in my path towards minimalism is setting up a capsule wardrobe.

I am being very systematic about setting it up.  I first clearly defined my style and made a list of all of the clothing items it would take to achieve it in spreadsheet format.  I highlighted all of the items that I do not own.  I then did a moderate purge of my wardrobe, making sure to keep the items on my list, but also keeping quality usable items that still fit my style to avoid being unnecessarily wasteful.

But now I have this list of highlighted items of things I need(?) to achieve my look.  And buying things (and browsing for things) on it is tempting and I feel legitimized by my spreadsheet.  But, I also feel like I'm failing. This damn list is letting me fall back into consumerism, even if it is more conscious than before.  I don't like it.  I don't want to be constantly working towards getting more things.  


Anyone else get trapped in these pitfalls?  Any suggestions on how to get out?",2019-09-04 05:38:54,57,145

minimalism,Finding peace with one bathroom,"I sold my house at the beginning of the year and my partner and I purchased a mid-century farmhouse that needs renovation. We had lived in a 1 bathroom home prior to me purchasing my home, but loved upgrading to 3(!!) bathrooms in my house and got quite comfortable with that. When we moved into the farmhouse, it was really hard moving *back* to a 1 bathroom home, especially one that was in need of many repairs and needs a complete overhaul (we'll even have to replace the floor/subfloor from water damage). 

Yesterday, I was purging stuff in the bathroom and there was just so much stuff from having 3 bathrooms. I'm the minimalist out of the two of us, but I have my weak spots. Shower curtains for all the bathrooms, towels, different soaps for each bathroom, daily shower cleaning sprays, multiple rugs, etc. It caused us to have to buy so many unnecessary extras! It felt really nice either transferring the soaps all into one reusable bottle or just getting rid of the stuff we no longer have a need for. I'm happy with how organized and clean the bathroom looks now (well, as clean as it can be in its state). One bathroom is all we need and I'm happy with that.",2019-09-02 05:20:35,44,170

minimalism,Living in a 20 square meters apartment?,"Hi everyone,

I am new here but love the idea behind this movement. So I will get straight to the point.

I want to move out and plan on getting my own place in the future. Saving up as of now.  I am looking to buy a 20square meters apartment just for myself. I don't plan on getting married or having kids in the future. I also plan for it to be a place for me for max 5 years.  I will travel abroad in the meantime to earn some money and then come back home to live off the earnings.

For backstory I live with my parents in a 2 storied house and have plenty of room, way too much unused space to be honest. I also lived in dorms where it was really crowded with 4 roommates  and had just a bed/table and a small wardrobe and it was enough for myself.

I also worked in the UK and rented a really tiny room in a house with a family. It was just a bed and a small table for my laptop close to it and a tiny wardrobe (I'd say it was 3 meters by 3). And to be honest I loved living in there. It was minimal to the core.  Which was as well fine by me. I didn't need anything more than that. I had a roof over my head so that's what is important. 

The thing about all of it is that I lived in tiny spaces but shared with other people. I would like to know how it is to be on your own.  Since considering the dimensions there would be a tiny kitchen and bathroom as well.

So I just wonder if someone here lived in a place of these parameters or close to (20sq m) and could share some of their experience. What to look for?  I don't want a studio as it is important that kitchen be separated from the room. I don't want to mix the cooking/grease with the bed. Thanks.",2019-09-02 02:19:38,19,12
minimalism,I love minimalism but I can't get out from consumerism...,"Hello everyone! It's been a couple of months since I reached the idea of ​​minimalism, it changed my life. I realized I had a mountain of useless things and many of these never used (I even had new shirts still with the shop tag, never removed).

Thanks to what the concept of minimalism gave me, some books and this community I was able to give away/donate almost everything I didn't need.

&#x200B;

I'm really happy, really!

&#x200B;

But I don't feel completely...the new me, I often feel the need to buy something, especially electronic, even if I don't really need it.

For example, long ago I had a MiBand 3 and when the new model came out I couldn't resist and I took it. And so it was with other things and, many years ago, with my phone (I changed phones every year).

Now, in part I can appreciate what I hold and understand why an object is part of me, but not for everything.

The purchase of a new electronic object almost becomes an obsession, I can't think of anything else, convincing myself that I really need it.

minimalism,taking a year off,"So, I came across someone on Youtube who had moved to Mexico City recently and after watching the video I was interested in the cost associated with it, and wow. 

You can find apartments for anywhere from $200 on the low end to $600/700 a month for a nice place, pair that with food being let’s say $300, (generous) and for around $1000 (also these numbers are all Canadian Dollars) you could live in Mexico City. 

So I thought to myself, what if I just took six months to a year off, lived in Mexico, maybe do some part time work and really learned who I am, developing good habits and really finding out, and focusing on what’s important? 

realistically this isn’t possible for a lot of people, wether it be kids, debt, bills whatever. But in my situation i’m currently in school for 4 years, why is it always, finish school and start working right away. 

I would LOVE to take six months off and live in Mexico city, in a new culture, developing myself, and finding what’s important, and essential to me.

I’m curious as to what others think? I hope this doesn’t come off as snobby or anything - i’ve only had this idea for a little while - but would love to hear your thoughts.

minimalism,"Getting rid of 20% of my cd collection, giving up on an “identity”.","I have identified myself a LOT through music in my teens. I got into rock, punk rock and eventually metal in high school and at the time it felt as if I had found my 'identity’; the group of people that I, an outsider for as long as I could remember, was a part of. It was the same time that I started buying band shirts, sew patches onto my backpack, got a couple of piercings and dyed my hair a crazy colour. Mind you, I was still the same sweet and kinda boring kid, but I finally felt part of something, I finally felt 'interesting’. 


I started keeping a collection of cd's that grew rapidly. Albums from the 70’s aren’t that expensive anymore usually so I was able to sustain my collection with my pocket and babysitting money. Cd’s made me feel 'cool’. Yeah, I’m that kind of chick collecting cd’s while everyone else is downloading music, look at how quirky I am. I *do* prefer cd’s over digitalized content tho, and still do. 


The hunger to grow my collection laid down a few years into tertiairy education, having accumulated over 200 cd’s. I moved to a tiny studio apartment a couple of years back, my boyfriend moved in with me, I started decluttering things because the place got too crowded and I eventually got into minimalism a year and a half ago. I’ve decluttered most of my wardrobe, a lot of kitchen stuff, pretty much all of my home decor, ... But I never touched my holy cd tower, I never even *considered* having a look at it to see if I could get rid of some cd’s. Through all of my declutter actions, I walked past it millions of times. They were just not something I would dare to touch. These cd’s, they represented everything I wanted to be during my teens and early tweens: a badass old school rock 'n roll chick who loved good rock music and went to underground concerts with her cool friends all the time. Truth is, I am not that person and never have been, even when I wore an oversized leather jacket over my Iron Maiden top. I do love the music, but I am “not cool enough to pull it off’ - and hey, I think I’m fine with that now… 


Today, for some reason, I looked at the cd tower and thought “man, I have a lot of cd’s and I probably haven’t listened to half of them in the past year”. I got up from my desk and went over all of them: I counted 226. I took them out one by one, decided whether I wanted to keep them or not and put the loved ones back. I decluttered around 8 cd’s. Wasn’t happy with that number, so I repeated the process. And repeated it once more. I’m down to 177 now. That’s still a lot, I realize, but there are a lot of cd’s I do frequently listen to and now I want to observe whether I’ll start listening to the ones I couldn’t part with yet more now that I have reduced my collection. Almost 50 cd’s will be given to friends or donated, I think that’s a fairly good start. I’m positive that, now that I finally acknowledged my collection as something I’m allowed to declutter, I will reduce it some more over the next months/years. And I will not be less interesting, less quirky, less *me* for it.",2019-09-01 13:36:16,39,146

minimalism,My journey into minimalism,"

I love reading about other people’s different journeys and views around minimalism, so I thought that I will share mine.

Growing up my parents were separated before I was born, we had a lot of things, both in my fathers house and my mothers apartments(we moved a lot), my mother was and still is the worse, not really a hoarder but close. That influenced me to get as much as possible when I got my first apartment, and did I ever get a lot of things crammed in to that one bedroom 34m2 (370ft2). I had a lot when I moved in and then just gathered more and more. Guitars, computers, recording equipment, piles of cds that didn’t get listened to, and books that didn’t get read, and so much more. this is from 14 years ago when I was 18 till when I was around 23 and moved across the country to Gothenburg from my tiny hometown way up north.
During that move a few things got sold or given away, but still filled a trailer with things to fit into the tiny room we where gonna rent in a friends apartment. We got our own apartment a year or so later, and then a year after that we moved again, but this time to Stockholm, and we packed everything we were gonna keep into a station wagon, and that car was so extremely packed it was comical, flowers sticking out everywhere, boxes packed so tight you couldn’t have fit a piece of paper between them. After six months here things ended and I moved to my own apartment(subleased), and that’s when my interest in minimalism started, at first it was empty because of me being broke, and living paycheck to paycheck, then after a while I noticed that I hade become much more at peace with having almost nothing, a bed, a computer, couch and a small table in the kitchen(this was a big apartment, around 100m2(1100ft2) two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and bathroom by myself.
So there was one piece of furniture per room and a few paintings I painted, and it echoed if you made noise, and I loved it. Then about three years ago I had to move as he was gonna sell the apartment, and I rented a room in a coworkers apartment. During the packing I noticed that I had so much more things than I thought I had, things I forgotten I had even bought, unnecessary gadgets, clothes I didn’t wear etc. And the room I was now renting was full of things, and so was the rest of the apartment, he has a hoarder problem. This is when I truly fell in love with minimalism and the thought of essentialism, I lived there for around three years, and during that time I reduced my things considerably and last weekend I moved out to a subleased apartment and living alone again, and I couldn’t be happier right now, moving was so easy, a bed, one medium size suitcase, one backpack, a plastic bin with some lights and books, a base guitar case, and three paintings. The rent is much higher but I will save about 60 hours in commute time a month, and that by itself makes it worth it, but to live alone again in a clutter free home is just fantastic.

A strange journey, but a liberating one to let go of emotional attachment to things that once held such importance, to old hopes and dreams, so that new ones can take their place without fighting for room.",2019-09-01 12:12:27,8,150

I've got a huge desk table that had a 27"" 1440p and a 24"" 1080p monitor on it, and I've given the small monitor to my parents to replace their old one. The main reason I wanted to let go of it is that the main use I give it is adding background imagery like having a video playing in the background or articles I could be reading, and the issue is that I'm not really paying attention to it. 

It used to be slightly useful years ago, when resolutions were smaller so I was in more need of screen space, but even then, I'd feel it only adds noise. Now I feel like I have a bit more of help to concentrate on what I'm doing and using my computer in a mindful way.",2019-09-01 11:10:25,27,31

minimalism,Why minimalism is sometimes hard,"This has probably been said so many times, but minimalism is countercultural. Every day, in any situation, we are made to think that buying more things or making more money will give us more security, more love, more friends, that it will eventually fulfill all of our emotional needs. Of course, in some situations, money will give us more security, but I believe you know what I mean. We aren't aware of that and even if you are someone who makes mindful decisions about your life, your money and your time, we aren't inmune to those messages. They appeal to our emotional insecurities. We know that our next purchase won't make us happy, yet we sometimes are tempted.

Just wanted to share my thoughts with you.

minimalism,Minimalism + Mindfulness + Meditation (MMM),"Hey everyone, just wanted to leave a little message of encouragement on your minimalism journey and process. Sometimes i can say that we can become so focused on getting rid of things (which i will agree is a ton of fun) that we forget that a big piece that makes this whole minimalist mindset work and be sustainable and enjoyable is our ability to be mindful and focused on one thing at a time.

Sensitivity is also something that we are all in the intellectual pursuit for. Being sensitive to others and your environment as you reduce how much waste you produce and how much space you occupy is super important and will help us bring love back into our hearts as we see the excessive that weighs down so many in this world.

minimalism,My parents think that there is something wrong with me,"Hey there,

I've been embracing minimalism over the past year or so and have found enormous benefits, my parents, on the other hand, think I am going crazy.

Rewind five years or so and I was at high school and an entrenched materialist. All I really cared about was the next thing  I was going to buy, and I saw my parents as the people I could manipulate into fulfilling my wishes. I think this was something to do with how I was raised; my parents were always working, they had more money than time, and let the latest video game do the parenting. 

I  realised how unhealthy this lifestyle was during university, and started to let go of lots of my desires. I thought this would bring me closer with my friends and family, and it has with my friends, but not with my family. They've been quite offended by my selling of things that they've bought me over the years: old laptops, computers, video games consoles, ect. I've tried to explain that these things weren't bringing me value any more, and I've offered them the proceeds, but neither were satisfactory responses unfortunately. I believe this is because of their materialistic outlook; they've both in a constant state of debt so much so that it's ruined their relationship and are constantly at each other's throats.

My mother has asked m a number of times if I have some sort of drug problem or gambling problem, or if I've joined a cult (after mentioning meditation), none of which are remotely the case.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of chasm of misunderstanding between you and loved ones? How have you dealt with it?

minimalism,Minimalistic piano piece Cosmos (by Asomnu) is sad poetry in my ears,"My boyfriend is a kind of pessimistic, not well known Spanish solo composer based in Madrid. Recently he published some of his songs officialy for the first time, and there is one in particular my brain can't let go: *Cosmos*. I find it so haunting yet reassuring at the same time...  back notes repeat over and over, but emotions flow and shift as the rhythm develops. It reminds me a little bit of Philip Glass theme for The Hours, though in a more intimate way as piano is the only instrument.

Minimalism for me is not only simplicity, but layers of inner complexity that find their way of appearing simple on the surface through hard work and sensitivity. Despite his doubts, I consider he has an amazing talent to express his feelings in his music in such a poetic way, and I am really proud of him for staying true to his passion. I hope this post can cheer him up a bit since he has been having a hard time lately.

minimalism,Trying to Streamline my Life & be More Minimalist,"I am looking for some advice and tips on achieving a more minimal lifestyle. I have already paired down a lot of my stuff and stopped making unnecessary purchases.

I have a lot of hobbies that involve technology though such as video games and watching movies. I am just trying to become more minimal and have a more productive life surrounded by less things but things I really care about. 
I also like going to the gym regularly. I know all these things make it difficult to be a minimalist but any kind of advice or ideas would be greatly appreciate

minimalism,Actio - a clean and minimalist activities tracker app,"Minimalism comes in different forms, and one that I particularly enjoy is the minimalism that I find in my daily apps. And since I couldn't find an app which would help me become more productive and less of a Procrastinator, I decided to create one by myself. 

And that is how Actio was born. Actio means activity in latin and sounded like a simple and effortless app name. The main aim of the app was to be as simple and as straightforward as possible, without compromising usability and important features. The app leverages a clean and minimalist design, having both Light and Dark mode, depending on preferences. You can add your daily/weekly activities, color-code them and set a duration and a reminder, and the app will take care of letting you know when you should start doing your activities, will fire a timer, and then tell you when it is done. This way, you won't miss to read a book before bed, do some yoga or any other activity that you might add.

It also keeps track of the days when you have or not performed your activities, and shows valuable insights and statistics based on those.

You can download the app from app store here: 
https://apple.co/2MKEn7C

I also launched the app on ProductHunt, so if you want to give me a feedback here, I would thoroughly appreciate that!

ProductHunt: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/actio

Also, you can follow us on Instagram, where I also have a little demo video which highlights the main features of the app, so you have a better overview of the app (it's also kind of 
funny):

minimalism,I’m so glad I hid away my son’s Paw Patrol toys.,"My almost 4 year old had every pup’s truck, plus triples of Rocky, and the massive Paw Patroller transport. It was a LOT of plastic toys littering our living room! He did play with them daily, until a couple of weeks ago when he stopped (because we were taking a break from this addicting, tantrum-inducing show). I took this opportunity to hide them all. These days, instead of just driving his trucks around, he’s being more imaginative with his play. This morning he is pretending it’s everyone’s birthday and wrapping some random objects with blankets to give as presents. And he’s cooking lunch with his play kitchen. He doesn’t often play pretend so this is nice to see. Goes to show that a kid doesn’t need branded toys, and that branded toys tend to push kids into close-ended play. Kids can use their imagination to turn ordinary objects into whatever they can think of.",2019-08-31 04:56:26,106,482
minimalism,Hoarding dog stuff,"Ex hoarder turned minimalist here!

I've been a minimalist for the past few years. Not at all perfect and not extreme, although it feels that way compared to the way I used to live. I held on to everything (just in case!) and took on everyone else's junk too! I also use to buy a lot of knick knacks for temporary feel-good boosts! 

So, I've been pretty content with everything I've been doing the last few years. I really consider whether I ""need"" products that I want and feel like everything I currently own has earned its place in my life as either a treasured)happy item or a useful/necessary item. 

However! One area I definitely overlooked was my dogs' stuff. One of the things I love most about being minimal is that my dogs have more space and the toys they own are hardy and long lasting (even for bull breeds!) But the other day I was really struggling to find something among their two large bins of things. 

Then I realised I was holding on to a lot of odd dog stuff so I sorted them into piles...


Useful/necessary stuff:

+ Lots of dog towels 

+ Medications

+ Passports

+ Toys



Happy, sentimental things (keep!):

+ Puppy blanket

+ Old doggy jumper for my rescue when she was underweight

+ First teeth and tags etc.



Things to donate to dog shelter/charity:

+ Several old leads/leashes and collars  

+ unsuitable toys and gifts



Things to throw away:

+ Old vet notes (can always requests these again)

+ Old paperwork (available online)

+ Old/expired medication and packaging (not sure why I held onto these??)

I feel so much better that I can donate the useful items to a shelter and got rid of weird things that I had no use for. Everything I kept, I put into order so it's easier to find things. Also I only need one large bin now instead of two!

My dogs will always be loved and spoiled but I realised I was hoarding a little too much on their behalf!",2019-08-31 01:21:52,0,5

I start so many creative hobbies like gardening, embroidery, painting, etc.  but the problem is I never do them consistently and don’t truly have the space to store everything for every hobby or project I have started. I have a very hard time letting go of stuff like this because of the monetary value I’ve put into it, and worry that one day I might decide to find more interest in these projects again or find that some of it may become useful. Maybe it’s an underlying guilt that I spent money on stuff that was just a impulse purchase? Yeah, it probably is mostly just that. Either way, how do you all handle this? Do you only allow yourselves to have so many hobbies? Or are there certain questions you ask yourselves to justify keeping this sort of stuff? Thanks for all input!",2019-08-30 22:20:41,14,12
minimalism,I'm trying a new (new to me) way of minimalism on social media.,"Maybe some of you have been doing this for a while, but this is new to me and I just wanted to share it. Some of you have found that deleting social media is the best. If that works for you that's great, but I find it too useful to delete completely. I also found myself wasting too much time scrolling through all my news feeds. So I decided to delete my news feed on every website. I can still get access to everything on the website, but I have to decide what I want to see. For example if I want to look at memes I can do that, but it has to be when I decide that I will look at memes, not when I'm just scrolling through the home page and memes are presented to me. I feel more free now that I have more control over social media instead of being forced to see whatever the site's algorithm wants me to see. Algorithms are meant to fuel addictions so the site makes a profit, not to present useful information.  


Facebook: A browser add on removes my news feed. If I want to see what my friends are up to I can chat with them or see their individual profiles, or actually talk to them in person.

Youtube: A browser add on removed all videos from the home page. I can still search any video I want, but it makes me be more conscious about what I watch.   


Reddit: I have unsubscribed from every subreddit including this one. I can still post anywhere I want, but once again I have to make a conscious choice about where I want to go on reddit.

Other social media: Twitter, instagram and other social media isn't important enough to me to even bother. I really don't care about those websites.  


Mobile: I use browser add ons, but what do I do about mobile? I only have 1-2gb of data. If I want more I have to click the button to buy another gb. If I need to use social media when I'm out of the house I can, but I have to keep in mind that it's limited and there's a ""fine"" for going over my limit.  


Has anyone else tried these methods? How is it working for you?",2019-08-30 19:17:51,1,5
minimalism,Anyone here found a way around paying rent?,"I've been living in hostels and airbnbs last 5 years in asia avoiding work but I finally want to start saving so I can semi-retire as soon as humanly possible. I really despise working, but I love living an extremely minimalist lifestyle. Only problem is my rent costs are 3-4x more all my other expenses. This is asymmetrical and annoying.

I'm extremely frugal, I spend under $2 a day on food and skateboard to work (where I also get free meals), I also spend $20 a month on the gym as a place to shower. Laundry I've been doing in the sink/shower. My phone bill is $10 a month. All my hobbies are free. Everything I own fits in a small backpack. This means my total expenses excluding rent are less than $90 a month!

Do I have some kind of OCD or mental illness? Tbh, I genuinely think I do... but I'm a pretty happy/content person, am physically healthy, have zero stress in my life, and a decent love life, so I feel no need to change my 'survival strategy'. I see life as a videogame being able to be happy with very few luxuries spending almost zero. It's satisfying idk why, and I'm not gonna change :(

Most annoying thing is I'm in the cheapest hostel I can find and it's $300 a month. I'd love to get that down to $100 somehow. I only go to my hostel/bedroom to sleep, I love being outside listening to audiobooks, skateboarding, playing sport, charging my phone for free at the gym to read reddit :P. 

 I see paying for bedrooms/hostels as a 'sleep tax'. I'm literally paying $300 a month to sleep (plus I don't even sleep that well with all the snoring.)

I've strongly considered stealth camping but it seems a lot of effort and I don't sleep so well if I'm stressed about getting caught. The same with car camping.

 Living with parents isn't an option. I am content existing anywhere as long as I have a warm sleeping bag and it feels safe. I also want to keep my autonomy and freedom so I don't want to couchsurf or work for accomodation etc. I hate the feeling like I owe someone something or they are doing me a favour.

Ideas for cheap places to get 8 hours sleep:

- sleep in a storage unit for $100 a month (illegal, sounds stressful as I read there are biohazards, fire hazards, risks of being locked inside etc.)

- sleep in a garage (illegal)

- sleep in an office (not actually that cheap and is illegal and sounds stressful)

- sleep in a tent in someones backyard (this would be awesome and could probably find someone to agree to $100? I would only use their wifi and maybe their toilet)

- sleep in uninsured van/car on someones driveway (I would car camp but gas and car insurance is super expensive in UK, also I dislike owning things).

Any thoughts or ideas? (Illegal or otherwise :P)",2019-08-30 18:32:06,14,5
minimalism,Challenging myself to do extremely minimal grocery shopping for the next month.,"So, a little detail.  I've recently realized that we hoard way to much food at a time. Hubby and I had over 100 cans of food, nearly 5 cabinets stuffed full with food, food on the counters, food on the fridge, a stuffed freezer, and a stuffed fridge.  I have been working to be come more minimalist in all my affairs. So, for that last two weeks we have not gone grocery shopping and only picked up things here and there as needed. Our freezer is much emptier and we are working on actually eating all of the hoards of food we have. So for the next month I am challenging my self to use up the majority of our food storage. I am realizing how long it takes to eat all these canned foods.  I am becoming painfully aware of how much food we have been wasting due to our lifestyle of excess food.

Right now it's just a small box, but I want to clean out my house for the new season and not hide junk in my closet out of guilt that it's going to sit in a landfill forever.

Any tips for just... tossing it and moving on? As I go forward I do try to acquire items that will last and not break, but certain things have just been in my possession for a while and are eventually falling apart.

Edit: Thank you for all the replies! For more context, my struggle isn't so much buying things and being surprised when I'm faced with the waste. Current items are non-functioning smoke detectors, expired debit cards and other plastic identification cards, empty pens and highlighters, old makeup, and old CDs. Ongoing items are personal care/health products that don't really have a waste-free option but I need/significantly benefit from them.

Hoarding probably wasn't the right word to imply a small amount of items, but I've kept these things in a box for so long and I just hate them haha. All of your replies have helped me realize these items exist regardless and I'm just cluttering my own life by keeping them.

Even important stuff like stuff from my bank or my car insurance probably doesn't even matter in my email anymore as all the documents can be accessed online.

Where I'm stuck is storage.  We have an attic.  It's really not packed with stuff, but there are certainly things up there that will not see the light of day.  Some things that I would get rid of, he wants to store such as the box of glasses that we haven't touched since we moved in a year ago ""in case we have a large number of guests"".  Part of me doesn't fully understand, but I don't see any good reason to get rid of it: it's in the attic and not in the way of my everyday life, it will only be a small issue when moving house which should be a rare occurrence, and it's not ""junk"".  Glasses are, indeed, useful items.  Of course, some things are still clutter, even in the attic such as unwanted gifts.

Firstly it wasn’t at all informative. It was basically an hour-long circlejerk, with the commentators talking in circles and repeating the same thing with different phrasing. We get it, consumerism sucks and you’re happier because your entire possessions include a chair, a guitar, and 3 outfits. But imo a minimalist lifestyle is much more than that and there were many things they didn’t touch on. Food, relationships, hobbies, etc



I also didn’t like the implication of quitting their successful corporate jobs as inherent to their minimalist lifestyle. I’m not rich by any means but I think it’s certainly possible to *possess* sums of money and have a successful career while still being a minimalist. If it makes them happier then go for it, but they acted like it’s necessary and inherent to minimalism.",2019-08-29 05:37:01,200,997

I know this is a very simple idea but I think that when buying things, especially things we are passionate about (my weakness has always been clothes and self-care items), we tend to not think rationally and in that moment it’s like we almost go unconscious.

minimalism,11 Things You Can Purge From Your Closet Right Now (and Not Miss),"This list was helpful to get started on cleaning my closet, so hopefully it will be helpful for others too.

# [11 Things You Can Purge From Your Closet Right Now (and Not Miss)](https://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/clothing/purging-tips?cid=423250&did=423250-20190828&mid=24003449996&utm_campaign=rs-weekly-tips_newsletter&utm_content=082819&utm_medium=email&utm_source=realsimple.com)

## 1) Hopelessly Outdated Trends

We’re looking at you, velour track suits. And while the style (like most others) will likely come back again one day, there's no need to clutter your closet with these out-of-style items in the meantime. 

## 2) Knock-Offs

Buying copycat fashion at a fraction of the price of the original designer piece is certainly tempting, but it comes with a host of sociological concerns, not least of which is the conditions workers making those fake goods endure. Clean your closet and your conscience by getting rid of anything in this category, and decide against buying knock-offs in the future. 

## 3) Cheap Halloween Costumes

You probably won’t want to pass that $15 “sexy police officer” costume down to your grandkids. Go ahead and toss out or donate all of the gear from Halloweens past. 

## 4) Bad Bridesmaid Dresses

Maybe you’re one of the lucky ones with a friend that has amazing taste and picked out a bridesmaid dress that you have actually worn since her wedding and [will wear again](https://www.realsimple.com/weddings/dress-attire/bridesmaid-dress-shopping). For all the others, it’s totally fine to let go of a dress you'll never wear again. Even better: donate it to Goodwill or a similar organization so the dress you have no need for can benefit someone else. 

## 5) Socks and Underwear With Holes

Many of us are probably hanging onto some socks or undergarments that are showing signs of wear. Now's the time to weed out these threadbare items, take stock of what you have, and decide if you need to refresh your collection. 

## 6) Mismatched Socks

Everyone has a drawer or a bag of these somewhere. If the matching sock hasn’t turned up within a few months, it probably never will. Get rid of any longstanding singles (or give them a [new use](https://www.realsimple.com/new-uses-for-old-things/new-uses-car?slide=82104#82104)).

## 7) Anything That Doesn’t Fit and Isn’t Worth Tailoring

If something fits you so poorly the alterations are going to cost more than the garment’s original value, let it find a home elsewhere. Consider donating these items, or if they're in good condition, you can sell them on sites like Poshmark. 

## 8) Painful Heels

It doesn’t matter how pretty (or expensive) they are. If a pair of pumps is so uncomfortable you always change out of them before you even leave the house, they’re just taking up space.

## 9) “Motivational” Clothing

Many women keep too-small clothing around as an incentive to lose weight, but doing so can actually be discouraging and takes up space that could be filled with clothes you'll actually wear. Get rid of the ""one day"" clothing and build a wardrobe that flatters you and that you feel confident wearing 

## 10) Anything That Makes You Feel Exposed or Uncomfortable

Whether you're still holding onto a stash of college T-shirts from schools you didn't even attend or free shirts from charity runs or work trips, it's time to let them go. These are great to wear when cleaning or painting, so keep a few favorites and donate the rest. ",2019-08-28 14:20:26,48,194
minimalism,Looking for a backpack.,"I don't know if such a post is allowed here or not, but I was looking for a good backpack since my older one broke and I need something to last me for a long time.

So I will make this short and simple:

**Price:** Something under €50, can spend a bit more if the product is justified.

**Size:** Something around 35L should be nice.

**What I carry:** My backpack has a cloth bag in it always, in case I need to pick some stuff up from the supermarket when out. Also I sometimes carry a 15.6"" notebook with charger. For everyday there are books, notebooks, water bottle, kindle, and some other small stuff such as chargers and power banks.

**Usage:** Main usage would be something I need for University and for carrying to my office. A secondary usage would be something I can take with me on hiking and when travelling.

Looking Forwards to your suggestions.",2019-08-28 12:37:12,4,1

minimalism,Minimalist Meditation App Recommendation for iPhone,"I’ve used quite a few of the popular mindfulness meditation apps such as Calm, Headspace, Waking Up, and 10% Happier. They’re all relatively good at what they do, but I’ve found myself seeking a simpler way to augment my meditation practice. A couple months ago I found Non a meditation app that uses generative sound which makes no two sessions sound alike. The app is remarkably simple with a  straightforward user interface and aesthetic. I’ve used it not only for meditation, but also as a timer for more focused working sessions. Non is completely free in the App Store.  No subscription. No notifications. No advertisements.

minimalism,What my t-shirt told me?,"Today after the morning ritual of taking bath, I took more than 20 seconds to decide what to wear, an anomaly that diverges widely from my usual behavior. I compared my recent acquisition – a [Fjällräven](http://www.fjallraven.co.uk/%E2%80%8E) bright colored T shirt with the rest of my wardrobe which is highly toned down in colors and comprises chiefly of what a typical management consultant would own.

For a brief moment I was swept by the revolutionary idea of buying more colorful clothes but Thanks to Diderot, I know better.

Denis Diderot wasn’t only a prominent French icon during the enlightenment era who now adorns the name of a [metro station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuilly_%E2%80%93_Diderot_(Paris_M%C3%A9tro)) and that of a famous [university](https://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) in Paris but also has his feet in the social consumerism. [**The Diderot effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect) is the feeling one has what I had today morning. Whatever one owns is worthless and it needs to be replaced.

Diderot effect has two fundamental premise:

1. All we own represent an identity of our i.e. we bought those things because they represent who we are.
2. New things we own can trigger a reaction to buy more things.

Things we own which represent who we are has externalised our personality to a degree that locus of our personality is not within us but somewhere outside. It’s similar to the quote from [Fight club](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) *“The things you own end up owning you.”* This weakness of ours is exploited by the big corporations and we buy more and more. That blue table we bought last month doesn’t go with *perfectly fine* chairs we own but because they *don’t go together*, we end up buying the new chairs. And the chain of buying stuff continues.

Fun fact: Diderot wrote an essay “[***Regrets of parting with my old dressing gown***](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/diderot/1769/regrets.htm).” He had a blue dressing gown which was replaced by a new red one. He compared his new gown with all the things he owned and felt how worthless they seem in front of his new gown. He decided to replace each item in his house and got into a huge financial debt.

I generally think life is shitty and not worth living for. There are so many awful people on this earth and we are destroying earth as we know it.

On my 19th birthday my father fell in a coma and passed away 3 days later. When my father passed away I remember the stress of having to clean out the entire apartment within a month. I'm getting rid of a lot of my own stuff. In the back of my mind I think ""if I die, my loved ones won't have to go through all my stuff, because I won't have a lot of stuff left"".

It's sad to hear so many people are going through the same experiences, but it also feels less lonely knowing I'm not the only one. I'll try to answer everyone's comments, but there are just so many, so I'm really sorry if I didn't respond to yours. Once again, thank you all for your nice and positive comments.

minimalism,Having doubts about minimalism as having few possessions,"I posted this as a comment on another post, but would love to get some discussion around this. This probably sounds negative but I'm hoping we can have a real conversation about minimalism as having few possessions.

I feel like all those people with 1 suitcase / backpack of possessions are fooling themselves. If you're outsourcing your cooking, furniture, bath items, tools, housecleaning, etc. then sure you can own nothing but you're not liberated from owning things. Instead you now need to spend a lot of time and money to rent / schedule services, and your life becomes more complex like if something comes loose and you don't even have a screwdriver, or you need to go out in the dark or find something and you don't have a flashlight. Also, why don't most of these ""all my belongings"" photos include social security cards and passports?

If your concept of minimalism is fitting your possessions into a few bags, then you also give up pets and most hobbies. Also, most people seem to ignore furniture when counting their items. I don't see what makes furniture special that it should be excluded. I mean, if you had no furniture, most people would go and buy/rent furniture and get bedding right away. Why not discount household supplies (towels, toilet paper, dishsoap, laundry detergent, etc.) and hobbies from your possessions as well then? Or exclude everything else... just so you can say you win the minimalism game by having 0 possessions?

So sure, there may be a few people who can live out of a bag (like long-term backpackers) and I would say those possessions are truly their only possessions. But for most people on this sub, let's be most honest about our possessions. I do believe in simplifying your life, and consuming less or being more aggressive about getting rid of things you will never use, but I think the ""all my things are in this photo"" style minimalism is inauthentic. So no, sorry but you do not have only 100 items, if you need to go out of your way to borrow a plunger when your toilet is clogged. You have many more items, but which you aren't counting because you're renting / outsourcing / excluding them and they add complexity to your life.",2019-08-27 15:03:09,67,87

I have a job where I need to look somewhat professional. I also I want to be  more of a ""uniform"" person but I also have a lot of body dysmorphia and don't feel comfortable in my skin very often.

minimalism,Why do I have the sudden urge to throw away everything and should I follow through with it?,"I've always been particularly attached to material things, to the point that when I was 10 or so I would reserve spots in my bedroom for ""worthy"" things and I would treat them right so that they wouldn't be offended. I was into buying stuff for the high you get the moment you get home with the product and I just always thought that was normal.

I used to be a big LEGO fan. I also bought lots of clothes. I thought I was into fashion but in reality I just had so many pieces of mismatched clothing I literally never used and kept, just in case.

But now that I'm 19 I'm suddenly disgusted by all of it. This happened in the span of a year or so. I want to throw away everything I don't really need and buy only the stuff I need. I really don't have a lot of stuff, it's just that I want to keep the bare minimum and throw away the rest. I don't know. I just want to dissociate myself with consumerism. I just like the idea of being able to pack everything into a backpack and just go. If I don't have space for it in there then I don't actually need that item.

minimalism,Best way to clean up/minimalize my phone?,"I am wanting to begin my journey into minimalism. I am moving in a few months, and I plan to donate/toss/repurpose of a lot of items I don't need.  
But one of my BIGGEST struggles for me and one thing that I am faaaar too attached to is my phone. I have a LOT of memories on my iPhone (-saying this for the sake of getting phone-specific help) and I dont have the heart to just wipe it and start clean with just the few essential apps. (phone, text, music, email)  
I currently have it always attached to my hip, partly because I am in a long distance relationship and my boyfriend and mine's only means of communicating is through our phones and we talk... pretty much all day. But in December I am finally moving in with him after a year of this and I think I will be a lot less dependant on my phone. but over the years I have gathered a lot of photos, videos, memorable texts, etc that I am just not comfortable saying goodbye to.   
What steps can I take to save these photos and start new? I want to have these photos still on me to look back. but i have at least 2,000 junk/unnecessary photos on my phone that i feel like would take HOURS to go through. i have MAYBE a hundred or two hundred photos that are very special to me on my phone. i also have hundreds of contacts in my phone.. at least half of them i dont talk to/were just contacts for work or job hires that i used ONCE. is there a way to MASS delete a lot of contacts or do i have to go in one-by-one? i probably talk to the same 5 or 6 people every YEAR. but have hundreds of contacts. and for whatever reason that gives me a lot of anxiety when i look at my phone.  
my phone gives me anxiety. when i have it on me, and when i dont.   
do i back up my phone on my laptop and wipe my phone and start over? do i just take the time and go through and delete the thousands of stupid memes, photos of dogs i see on the streets, and ugly selfies? (hehe)   
also, im someone who (admittedly) has an addiction to iphone apps. i have WAY too many and i dont use probably 70% of them but when i go to delete them i say to myself ""i MIGHT need it one day."" and i think that's really unhealthy. how can i let stupid phone apps go that i'll probably never use and if i really need them can just redownload?  
show me screenshots of your minimalist phones, inspire me, tell me how you went from phone addict to being able to go a whole week without your phone if you go on, say a camping trip? please help. i can donate clothes, i'll get rid of silly knickknacks. but my phone is going to be the hardest addiction to beat in this journey. i need it to communicate with my boyfriend, my father (who is across the country), with work.... but i hate how panicky i get without it.

But I'm a bit torn here. I have some plain solid color t-shirts, that were pretty cheap (think F21, H&M) and aren't the best quality. I don't like the feel of the synthetic fabrics and they don't fold very neatly, like you can tell they weren't made with great quality control so the shapes of the fabric panels are a bit off. 

I'd really like to replace them with something of better quality, something more sustainable, I was considering Everlane. But it's ultimately cheaper and more sustainable to buy nothing and just be happy with the meh quality stuff I have now. Can anyone share their experience with these kinds of situations?

minimalism,Kindle vs a Library Card,"I like to read and I've become quite conscious of acquiring books.  I was spending a lot of money on books and found that even buying used was rarely much more affordable than new.  I've wanted to start purchasing more ethically and switching to e-books seemed to make more sense to me.  So, I bought a kindle.

Now I am really questioning the wisdom of that purchase:

1. E-books are cheaper, but the kindle was £100, so it's going to take a while before I purchase enough books to make up that cost.
2. If I want to purchase ethically, buying from Amazon is not the way to go about it.
3. I also wanted to use it for cookbooks, but the format is just no good for it.

But, I know they are so popular, particularly with the minimalism community.  So, why do you love your kindle?  

So far, convenience seems like the best reason: the moment that I want a book, it will be in my hands and it takes up even less space on a carryon than an actual book.  But a library card gives me access to free/cheap books, I do not acquire books once they're read, I can try out new cookbooks for a few weeks (and then buy them used if I like them).  Heck, we even have a mobile library that comes to my office once/month and our main library is in our town centre which I visit weekly.

\- Black jeans fading. I've tried to re-dye them before but they last one wear and then it seems to wash out immediately after (maybe I'm doing it wrong?).

minimalism,How to move towards minimalism in a relationship?,"I live with my girlfriend. She moved all her stuff into my place and this includes many boxes of unused clothing, countless bottles of bathroom and laundry goods, the fridge is full of old food nobody wants to eat, heaps of just junk and papers all over the place.

Now I don't want to force her to change. She was very much unconscious of all her consumption, constant desire for new clothes, makeup and nonsense without really knowing why. She used to drive 2 hours to a big mall just to buy very expensive makeup products for no god damn reason at all. She looks more beautiful without it. 

Anyway. Over time she's learned that she doesn't need piles of new shit and shopping is an awful waste of money and time. And to just enjoy the moment and doing fun and interesting things rather than buying buying everyday. 

But she's still very finnicky about her things. Doesn't want them touched, never goes through it or cleans, still holds on to cages and bags of stuff for a deceased pet. We're planning to move overseas not long away and this stuff has to go. I want her to let it go peacefully and in a relieving way. How can I go about that?",2019-08-25 18:07:08,5,0
minimalism,Minimalism Wardrobe? Really?,"New here, but the first step on my minimalistic journey is gonna be my wardrobe. I have too many clothes that I don't use and getting rid of them is especially important considering my condition of living in a small place with 4 more people 

I have seen some videos where people show their minimalistic wardrobe where the have 12 of the same shirt. For each shirt.

I can be mistaken, but is this truly minimalistic? I don't think minimalism is much about simplicity as it is about EFFICIENCY. You don't need 12 shirts. Doesn't matter if they all look the same or not. There's 7 days in a week, I think you can do with 2 sets of 7 pieces of simple T shirts, 2-3 pair of pants, and some winter/summer clothes.

Can I be mistaken, or do people seem to want to ""look"" minimalistic instead of actually being? Do I have the wrong idea about what minimalism actually means?

Edit: Sorry If I expressed myself poorly, I'm not trying to act like the supreme judge of what is/isn't minimalistic, being I myself am new to this idea. Each person has their needs and knows what they have to do to supply those needs. I just pointed out because I have seen a lot of people having lots of clothes and I have always been under the impression such a large quantity would be unecessary, in MY experience of course (I can't speak for everyone, sorry if it sounded like I wanted to), and would like to know how you guys delt with the whole cloths situation.

minimalism,Minimalism leads us to Consumerism? And the 3 strands of Minimalism,"**Minimalism and Consumerism**

I often notice that when people turn to minimalism in their lives, it often forms into a consumerist mindset.

For example, someone might decide they need to buy a whole new “simple” wardrobe of the same X T-shirt’s, instead of cutting down on what they own. Or throwing away decent items In their home in favour of multi-tools.

How can we justify this behaviour? By being minimalists we are all standing up to the rampant consumerism we see in our lives, however the journey to becoming a minimalist often leads people to buy new stuff and getting rid of the old, instead of just pairing down what they own first. How can we talk about having the essentials in our lives when some turn to buying more at the start of our journeys? And how can we ethically justify this expense to the exploited workers producing our goods?

**The 3 Strands**

I suppose this comes down to different ‘strands’ of minimalism, which I propose to be:

* aesthetic minimalism
* practical minimalism
* ethical minimalism

I’d love to know how you balance these in your lives? And are some strands of minimalism more important to you than others?

minimalism,"How do strike the balance between cost, quality and desire?","My general rule is to buy the best quality I can afford, but in practice that's not always so easy. Technically I could afford many things, but I'm not always prepared to spend it.

For most things, I can find a sweet spot, but today I went to upgrade my mobile phone  and found that I actually am still very attached to this idea of ""perceived quality"", despite trying to be more mindful with what I buy.

See, I've had the same phone for 3+ years and have loved it, and only decided to upgrade because I cracked the screen pretty badly and the repair price was eye-watering. I went in with a pretty good idea of what I wanted, but once there, the price was coming up too high for the budget I had. My only real deal-breaker with smartphones is the camera - that's the only part I care about. The rest is just whatsapping and stuff, which I would happily do on the cheapest one available. But I really do care about getting good shots, so I settled for a mid-range phone that was way cheaper and supposedly (according to specs) still had a fantastic camera.

Great, I thought. The price was low, the phone was good, I thought it was a perfect compromise. I felt very in tune with my own minimalist principals of finding that sweet spot. I wasn't paying over the odds for a flagship model, or for that 'premium feel'. I just found what was important to me and let the rest go.

But when I got home, I felt cheated. The camera is... fine (in no way bad, but not amazing). My last phone was top of the range at the time, so I could tell the difference. The case is plastic instead of glass. The interface a little less sleek. It just feels... cheaper.

When I ask myself if I'm happy with this phone, my answer is no. But when I ask myself *why*, it's really arbitrary, superficial reasons. I do believe I have found that sweet spot. It's not budget, it still costs a substantial amount as it's a good phone. But I would be paying a ridiculous amount of money for the better one, and it would be packed full of things I don't need or use. So why am I not happy with it? I still want that 'better' phone. I can *feel* myself wanting it.

Why? Because I have been sold the idea that it's better, cooler, fancier than this one? Or do I genuinely wish I had a better camera, because that gives me a lot of joy?

It's a really interesting situation to be in, being able to feel that pull towards a product whilst also being able to recognise that I am being pulled towards it by something other than a need. I find this kind of stuff the more difficult side of embracing minimalism. Realising how influenced I still am by desiring the best, and realising how much inner work it takes to keep yourself aligned with your own principals. It's constant work.

So, how do you strike a balance between these things? I don't want my minimalism to become an excuse to always have the best of everything. I know a few folks who have top-of-the-range tech, expensive clothes, bedsheets that cost hundreds of pounds, because they're whats trendy and think is best quality.

minimalism,"How do you deal with the downsides of ""all digital"" media?","Most minimalists seem to recommend digital subscriptions (Spotify/Netflix), digital stores (Google Play/iTunes), and cloud storage. We all know the benefits to these services, but what about the downsides? It's less suffocating without the bookshelves full of stuff, but now quality is diminished and curation is harder.

You're either locked into a neverending subscription or at the mercy of the storeowner, hoping that they'll never close down or revoke your purchases. You're dependent entirely on a stable internet connection with no data caps either way, and will always have worse AV quality. Unlike physical media, you can't just get rid of old movies and music you previously bought but don't want anymore. And if you go with subscriptions, you always have the service feeding you a neverending stream of garbage you don't want and pestering you to ""watch more!"" It's hard for the library you really want to ever fully be there. Where's the intentionality and curation minimalism values so much?

Of course, the same applies for home media. Keeping all personal photos and videos on a company's server might be great in case of a fire — but what if you get banned or they suddenly lose your data? What if someone's looking through my personal stuff?

I've build a home server before, but that's a massive headache as well. Even for fairy tech savvy people, it's a lot of maintenance and requires either a pre-existing stock of physical media to rip or resorting to piracy. Organizing your personal photos and videos is another pain that quickly gets overwhelming too. And then it sort of loses the magic of the rest of this digital stuff — I can have access to everything on any device from anywhere in the world (despite how unlikely it is that I'd become a nomad).

What's the best way to handle all of this stuff? Just stop caring about digital clutter and drops in quality? Is there even a place for media in a simple lifestyle, or should one go more ascetic? Is there something I'm missing?",2019-08-23 22:07:33,42,32
minimalism,I want a digitizing media blitz in my future. Advice?,"Part of my minimalist efforts this year will involve reducing the physical weight and bulk taken up by movie and music media. I have VHS tapes, CDs, a big tote of ancient music and spoken word cassette tapes, and a tightly-packed crate of vinyl records. Ideally, some of this will simply be donated or thrown out, some of this will be converted to digital files, and a few gems will be kept as keepsakes.

I am daunted, though. First, it seems like it could be *very* time-consuming, and that strikes me as not in the minimalist spirit (I don't want to waste months on this when I have better ways to use my time). But I also have doubts about finding the right equipment to do it properly.

CDs are easy, though slow--I can rip them on my desktop computer. But I will need to buy some kind of adaptor(s) for the rest. I briefly researched this a year or so ago and it seemed far more complicated than I imagined.

minimalism,Becoming a minimalist. Struggling on what to leave behind and bring with me.,"I suffer from anxiety. It has been incredibly difficult for me to maintain several interests and hobbies without stressing about not giving enough time to the more important things. 

So I made some improvements. I sold all the stuff I don’t use or are just deluxe devices I can live without. My laptop (I have a desktop), my iPad (didn’t use it much and I have an iPhone), everything. 

I have almost quit videogames. I’ve forcefully uninstalled all the video games I own from my PC, and I currently am finishing off one game from my ps4 before I sell it. Yes, videogames are enjoyable, but I have lost enjoyment I once had with them, they stress me out, and so forth. Also, it will save me money in the long run. When I build a pc again, I can go for cheaper components, and the money I save can fund more important things. 

I have decided to commit myself to learning guitar. I’ve been slowly playing for a year, and recently I have discovered rocksmith as being a great tool to help me learn, and my progression is speeding along. Guitar isn’t 100% enjoyable, but once I get to a position where I can play music I really like at a higher skill level, I will be much more satisfied. Furthermore, it’s a nice skill. 

I quit social media. I have no friends anyway. But it stops me from seeing how happy everyone around me is whilst I’m depressed. 

Now, I’d like to start reading, but I find it incredibly boring and hard to concentrate. Deletion of social media may aid me with this.

minimalism,What do I do with my piano?!,"A little background: Since I was a kid, I was deeply moved and inspired to play the piano after listening to pianists on youtube. I went on to take piano lessons for a few years, eventually quitting due to the frustration of not learning how to read sheet music well. 

About five years ago, I bought a digital piano in hopes that I’d teach myself to play at a decent level after some time. Despite this, aside from messing around on it every now and then, I haven’t made any real progress with learning to play. 

On one hand, I only want to keep what brings me joy, and at the moment the piano doesn’t (because I’m not that good at it and feel like I will never be). On the other hand, MANY people have encouraged me to keep the piano since learning to play an instrument is enriching/life changing/I’ll regret never learning to play/it gets better/etc.

It feels daunting to learn to read music and play beyond beginner level. I feel like if I haven’t made any effort to learn for this long, I might as well sell it and focus on other hobbies that are easier to tackle. The minimalist in me is saying I can always enjoy listening to piano music rather than learning to play it. Part of me also feels like it's part of my ""fantasy self"" to be good at playing piano, not my ""actual self.""

My problem is, that minimalism really made me think about life and it's purpose way too much. It started with selling the stuff I don't need (including my car). 

But now I am questioning the purpose of everything.

Why buy a suit? Doesn't make me smarter. It's just a social concept of dressing nice that serves no purpose other than to impress people.

Why strive for anything? So I can increase social status? I don't care anymore. 

But it gets worse. I used to be proud of my career. Not anymore. Too many people taking themselves way too seriously and think of themselves as important and ""better"". 

I have become somewhat depressed not by minimalism per se but by the overthinking of all the stuff we do on a regular basis that have no reason besides impressing people.

I'd like to clarify that I am not reallly depressed. It's just weird when you find out at 32 that the mainstream approach to life (acquisition of as many material possessions as humanly possible) is not really your thing. And I am not even judging that.

If you're not religious, there is no real predefined purpose in life.

minimalism,Conquering Compulsive Behaviors: the 4 steps to personal freedom,"*Hey guys, sorry for the word vomit. Personally, I found this method to be incredibly helpful in finding more control in my life. I pray that it can be of use to you as well. I'm trying to become a better writer, so any constructive feedback would also be greatly appreciated. Be sure to comment if you have anything to add to the article!*

&#x200B;

All too often the progress that we make towards reaching our goals is sabotaged by unhealthy behaviors. I’m sure you also know the feeling of starting a new exercise routine, resolving to waste less time online, or planning to eat healthier, only to find yourself postponing your workout until after the gym’s closing time, binge watching Netflix at 3 AM, or begrudgingly tearing into a big mac after passing the McDonald's on your way home from work. The diet’s actually starting tomorrow, right?

Compulsive behavior is an incredibly common problem, especially among young people, and should not be the cause of undue shame or frustration. What needs to be realized is that no amount of discipline will allow any person to consistently overcome compulsive behavior. We act compulsively because of patterns that we’ve developed from prior negative experiences and their solutions. Take, for instance, compulsive eating. Dan has had an extremely stressful day and is absolutely miserable. He’s about to get into his car and head home to eat the dry chicken breast in the fridge because he’s on a diet. But he’s starving. Suddenly, Dan is approached by a friend who had picked up a batch of burgers to share; Dan takes two after trying halfheartedly to turn him down. Dan eat the burgers, and almost instantaneously feels a little better. Some of the fatigue of the day has been lifted, and he becomes a bit happier. From that point, Dan has associated fast food with relief. Now, years in the future, he’s made a routine of getting fast food whenever he feels tired or stressed out. The food no longer improves Dan’s mood, frankly it makes him feel even more tired and lethargic, however, he continues to persist in the negative habit. Why are these types of habits so easy to adopt while one can struggle fruitlessly for years trying to build a positive habits? 

The answer lies in the mechanism by which we represent our experiences. In the example of Dan the compulsive eater, food initially represented an escape from his unhappiness. Dan felt stressed out and the burgers helped to alleviate some of his suffering. From that point, he implicitly associated eating burgers with relief from unhappiness. Years later, although the frequent diet of fast food had become taxing on his health, Dan persisted in the habit because of what he believed it had given him. 

Your brain rewards you for doing things that it feels would provide you some benefit. We receive a hit of dopamine when we accomplish something that we consciously or unconsciously desire. Dan desired relief from stress and, due to his brain’s association between food and stress relief, he was rewarded with a hit of dopamine each time he continued the unhealthy habit. With this information, the pattern of compulsive behavior can be predictably mapped to appear something like this: 

Triggering stimulus -> emotion/memory of past experience -> Dopamine from expectation of doing compulsive behavior(constant) -> Acting out compulsive behavior -> Dopamine received from behavior(decreasing)

In Dan’s case with burgers, it looked more like this: 

Sees burger restaurant -> Remembers that in the past burgers=less stress -> Get excited by recalling feeling of first burger -> Buys/eats burger -> Feels like crap and guilty

The key to limiting and ultimately eliminating compulsive behavior is exploiting this relatively predictable mechanism. By identifying the stages of compulsion and recognizing when you, yourself, are feeling these urges, it is possible to interrupt your established patterns and instead construct new habits. Here’s how to make it happen:

1. Identify the stimulus

The first step to eliminating your unwanted behavior is to identify whenever you begin to experience these urges. Does the sight of golden arches cause your stomach to start rumbling? Does a seemingly overwhelming amount of emails built up in your inbox compel you to open  Netflix for a ‘quick break’ before starting to work? Carefully consider what triggers you may be seeing or hearing which could compel you to carry out compulsive behaviors. Try to perform this exercise in assessing all of your unhealthy habits. It’s also critical to notice not only the physical cues behind your compulsions, but your emotional cues as well. A good way to hone in on this is to ask yourself if you’re feeling specific emotions, and try to triangulate from there. Am I frustrated, sad, overwhelmed, or tired? Oftentimes, these emotional cues can be even more effective at causing us to engage in compulsive behaviors than physical ones. The next time you find yourself sucked into some pattern of compulsive behavior try to remember this: firstly, don't beat yourself up over it; secondly, really make an effort to notice whatever stimuli brought you into that pattern.

2. Understand your experience

After you begin to identify which factors cause you to fall into patterns of compulsive behaviors, the next step is to understand why you adopted those behaviors in the first place. One of our unconscious mind’s most important purposes is the encouragement of behaviors which have been beneficial to us in the past. Remember Dan? What triggered Dan’s compulsive fast food consumption was the relief that he found in eating those first two burgers. From that point on, Dan’s mind associated junk food with an escape. What associations are driving your compulsive behaviors? This example may be helpful: an ever growing compulsion among people these days is shopping, especially online shopping. Due to one-click checkouts and cards on file it’s very easy to fall into the trap of buying stuff as a form of relief. When diving into the underlying motivations of these compulsions, although it differs among individuals, a common association with buying things online is a sense of control and achievement. If eating burgers and buying junk online actually did fulfill these human needs without causing further issues, there would be no problem engaging in these behaviors. Oftentimes though, not only do we fail to meet our needs, but we also end up causing greater problems for ourselves in the long run. This is why it it is often best to replace the behavior entirely.

3. Re-anchor your signal

Once you’re able to identify the triggers behind your compulsions and understand how those actions have been beneficial to you in the past, you’re ready to begin implementing this pattern-breaking technique to end your compulsive behaviors once and for all. The key is that we’re still searching to fill the needs which drew us to pursue the negative behaviors in the first place. Whenever we engage in our compulsions, what we’re really searching for are the feelings we found when doing the actions for the first time. While we may not receive these feelings from our old patterns of behavior, it’s possible to deliberately replace our compulsive actions with constructive behaviors which will fill our needs. In Dan’s case, rather than go to buy fast food when he’s feeling stressed out, he could instead use that sensation as a trigger to reflect on how far he’s progressed in terms of work and his other accomplishments. He could give himself the excuse to lie back for a few minutes, fix a healthy snack, play some relaxing music, and bring to mind positive thoughts. This would bring him much more relief than ordering fast food could, and leave him with positive after-effects, rather than guilt from breaking his diet. Over time, this new pattern of behavior will replace his old, compulsive reaction, effectively re-anchoring his response to the original signal. The key, when determining an alternate behavior, is to identify the original needs driving your compulsive behaviors, and then fill those needs in a positive way. After some time of consistently practicing with this new anchor, you won’t even consider falling back into your original compulsions because your needs will be better met than ever before. 

4. Eliminate unnecessary triggers

Although this method is effective at changing your reaction to compulsive thoughts, allowing you to interrupt and reestablish your behavioral patterns, you may still occasionally be tempted to engage in the negative behavior, especially if you struggled with the compulsion for a long time. Each time your impulse is triggered, there is a small potential for relapse. With the tools you’ve been given, you can better separate yourself from your negative habits, however, it is wise to eliminate potential triggers as well. After changing your habits for a few months, it will become dramatically easier to resist your compulsions, and the urges will also arise less frequently. In those first few months after setting your new anchor, it is crucial that you lower the possibility of relapse in any way that you can, That means deleting your cards from online websites if you compulsively shop, or bringing a healthy snack with you for after work so you have food and are less tempted to stop by McDonald's on the way home. Ultimately, to make any large changes you need to be proactive in determining what direction you want you want your life to be heading. By making temporary sacrifices right now, your future will be better than you could ever expect.

Now that you have the tools to identify your patterns of  compulsion, understand what needs you are trying to fill through your behavior, and change your overall reactions, you are ready to begin taking control of your life! I would recommend that you start small, but think big. Get comfortable putting these lessons into practice and slowly build up your successes until you’ve created the life of your dreams. It is important to consider each relapse or setback not as a failure, but as an opportunity for learning and growth. Use these moments to re-calibrate, and begin again from the fundamentals when you’re ready. Only you can end your compulsive behaviors; only you can choose what's best for yourself. With the knowledge that you’ve just learned, that future is in your reach.",2019-08-23 01:10:46,0,13

With all the free time I have, I always feel the need to be doing something or 'productive.' I often fill my time with studying for advanced certifications and researching things in my field, reading and listening to a variety of books, about 1-4 books per week, cleaning/errands and other day to day stuff, I walk most days, etc. 

I feel that I don't know how to rest or just enjoy being. This feeling has been amplified with more time available and I tend to just keep pushing myself... For fear of ""wasting time."" 

I think I'm avoiding being lonely when my husband is not home, honestly. I have no friends here locally... 

What do you do to truly relax, that doesn't invlove checking things off a list or purposefully contributing to a goal in any way? What are you 'positive time wasters' that add value to your well being?

minimalism,Do you ever feel like you're doing the wrong thing?,"I recently found some photos from when I was a teenager. I don't know why I still had them, because for the most part I haven't kept much from my childhood. They aren't super sentimental photos - they're just some disposable snaps from when me and some friends met a member of a band we really liked. I thought they were a cool enough memory to snap a photo of them on my phone and send to my friend to reminisce.

After I did that, I ripped them up and tossed them in the recycling bin with the rest of my trash. I didn't think anything of it until my friend text back saying they were cool photos and she had forgotten all about them, and jokingly said I should frame them. I laughed and said ""can't anyway, I threw them away"".

Her response was of utter shock. She could not fathom why I would do such a thing. Like she was genuinely horrified. She said I should have put them somewhere safe, why on earth would I do that, they were good memories. I tried to explain, and reasoned with her that the photo still exists (literally right there, in our WhatsApp chat). But she just could not even remotely agree with me, and said that the physical photo is what's important because it's the original, and that I'm far too ruthless with things.

It's moments like these that I question myself. It's not the first time I've had moments like this. Usually it happens when people find out I havent kept a single note from university, or any of my schoolbooks etc. I recently when on a trip with some friends to Amsterdam, and they were baffled each time I tossed my tickets or leaflets away, because they saw them as keepsakes. Sometimes they literally fished them out of the bin! I buy a fridge magnet everywhere I go, and I also bought a miniature mug as a memento to put a plant in. Why would I need my tram tickets and museum stub to take home and sit in a box? People feel really strongly about this it seems!

Sometimes I feel like I am doing something ""wrong"", even though it feels right for me. And then I start worrying that I HAVE tossed away something meaningful that I will one day regret.

minimalism,"I love Gaming, but Don’t have a lot of Time on My Hands. Any tips or Techniques for cutting back?","Hey All. So starting this year I’m putting a lot of effort into becoming a professional artist, so I need to focus mainly on my work. Having said that I still do love to game whenever I have enough time for it. Yet I almost feel like having too many games is a burden in of itself, so I’m thinking of ways to minimize my game collection and future collecting habits.

Listed below are a few of the methods I’m planning to follow in order to minimize my gaming habits while still enjoying some.

1. Get rid of longer games in my physical catalogue, JRPGs especially. It’s not that I don’t enjoy these styles of games, but I find that they take more time and effort than I currently have available.

2. Get rid of handheld gaming consoles. As it stands I don’t really have a job that I need to commute to, so the 3DS and Vita that I own currently don’t serve a purpose outside of the home. Maybe this will change when I end up moving, but I feel it might be another hurdle I must overcome to mellow out my grip on gaming.

3. Cut down game wishlist for future games to less than 10 games altogether. Maybe this is a bit extreme but I almost feel I need that sort of crunch to prioritize which games are most important to me.

4. Cut down the number of Indie Games that I would want/ get rid of some that I already might have physically or digitally. I acknowledge this might be the biggest gaming problem I have; somehow the appeal of passion projects developed over multiple systems for a lesser price leads to me purchasing way more of them than I need. The art direction and alternative gameplay mechanics put into them just speaks to me, though.

5. Ignore future consoles or any games for consoles outside of the ones that I already own. This way I won’t feel like I’m missing out on anything, or if I really can’t help myself I’ll just watch a stream. I know, it doesn’t feel the same as actually playing, but I guess some sacrifices have to be made.

6. Stick to one gaming platform. Mostly thinking of sticking to Playstation 4, since I should focus on using my Mac and Surface computers for work exclusively. Also I have more digital games for the system than either my Steam and GOG catalogues (unless I combined the two of course XD).

Again, these are just a few ideas. I guess what I’m really posting for is if there are any other techniques that could help guide me in the right direction, guidance for if I’m at a good pace with my current plan, or if there’s some methods listed that I should reconsider.

I’d really appreciate the input here friends. This is a pretty big step that I’m trying to take to get on with my life with as little regret as possible. Thanks.",2019-08-19 17:01:20,7,7

I have some sort of skin condition not sure what it’s called where I am itchy all the time, acrylic and chiffon etc are unbearable. I ideally like cashmere, linen/cotton blends, and icebreaker clothing materials.

Edit: WOW. Thanks you for collaborating with me!

What I’ve learned: It’s hard! Nobody should be shamed, we didn’t ask to be born into this shit! Second hand is best, thrifting is best but knowing where to donate your clothes to is crucial!! (Try to post an ad online, donate to a shelter, resell if you have the time, trade, swap, try not to donate to big corporate thrift chains but it’s okay if you feel you have to right now!) making clothes and sewing clothes is much harder than I thought and much harder in a world where you’re not brought into a world where that skill isn’t offered one on one.
Ethical brands can be super expensive!!! But think of it, the more people buy one thing from them, the more they can be resold/traded by human to human not corporations , sustaining their quality and yet becoming more accessibly priced! Practicing my sewing skills on fabric scraps before buying fabric. Tip: I find good fabric from nightgowns, men’s shirts, house coats, sheets, curtains at thrift stores.

minimalism,Minimalism and experimental music,"I play harsh noise, ambient, and metal music, and I believe experimental music and minimalism go hand in hand very well. With my music, I’ve noticed that over the years I naturally gravitated towards minimalism. To me, there is so much you can do with so little if you simply slow your brain down and open your mind up to unconventional experiences.

[For example, this is an 18 minute drone piece I composed.](https://open.spotify.com/track/04qjdtE28Btt9hd5VgT0v8?si=YefDOWDYTUCUd1NraSyCZQ) It consists of one guitar and some effects. In that 18 minutes, you’ll only hear maybe 4 or 5 different chords, some of them playing for literally minutes at a time. Most people listening will be asking “when does the song really start” or “when is something going to happen?” But plenty is still happening if you slow yourself down to its level.

Normally, movement in a song is created with notes, melody, harmony, that kind of stuff. But what if we focused on other things to create movement? If we’re playing a drone, we can’t create movement with melody, and what if I don’t want harmony? I could use harmony to keep the energy I want flowing, but dammit everyone uses harmony to accomplish that. I can do so many other things - introduce feedback or noise in such a way that interrupts, cut to complete silence for a a split second, adjust a filter or EQ to make the sound just slightly different enough to illicit a different mood, play the note softly or really hard to get different overtones and harmonics coming out of the amp to keep the same mood but give it a slightly more organic flow. Etc. There are infinite options, basically. Most musicians are stuck using the same theories and techniques because they are tried and true, but what if we wanted to create new techniques to create new kinds of experiences? What could be possible?

You’re taught in music class different ways to smoothly transition between keys in a song so it doesn’t sound too disjointed. But what if your goal is to disorient? Then there should be no need to use that passing chord. It may sound ugly at first, but doesn’t that really have more to do with the way we are conditioned to hear music? If we want the music to sound ugly and it does, isn’t that mission accomplished?

That’s my take on experimental music, and that brings me to minimalism. Minimalism helps me highlight these ideas. It either turns you off or forces perspective. It solicits focus. It puts a microscope on ideas and appreciates them on an entirely different level. It’s not just about drinking coffee, it’s about learning how to grow coffee beans then starting a garden etc and then at the end you put can put it all together if you want. If drinking coffee is a pleasant experience, then grinding the coffee can be too if you open yourself to the idea, as can growing your own beans, or finding the kind of bean you like best, etc. 

Most music is a delicious cup of coffee. Experimental and minimalist music, to me, is more like the steps to making the coffee as if they were cups to drink themselves, instead of just being a means to an end. You can get as much out each step individually as you can the grand complicated result when you mix everything together. In fact you may be able to get even more out of them. It’s easier for me to find deeper appreciation and understanding for whatever the art is conveying to me, even if it’s obscure at first. Abstractness just means it’s more personal because you get to fill in more blanks yourself instead of being told exactly what to feel. It’s just as valid an experience.

What do you think? How do you appreciate minimalism in music? Any other experimental music fans or artists around here?

minimalism,Shoe collection,"I know there’s a ton of posts about shoe setups. I’m trying to find an ideal setup for myself. I live in Chicago (Hot summer/Cold winter). My current setup is as follows:
Low top converse
Padded high top Ralph Lauren
Running Shoe
Doc Marten Boots
Dress shoe

I wear my converse as everyday shoes. The high tops I use for work (I work inside a freezer). The running shoe are for the obvious. I hardly ever wear the dress shoes (they’re there for security). I use the boots for the winter snowfall or excessive rainy days.

My low tops and high tops are almost ready to be tossed out. I would like to find a shoe that can be used as both. The shoe should be very plain in design and match with denim, be able to handle daily biking and occasional skateboarding, thick enough that I can’t feel the temperature of the floor through them. I would prefer the shoes to be low top as I get very claustrophobic in high top shoes. I can always double up on socks for when I work. If possible I would also like to do away with the running shoe and merge its utility with this one.  

I’ve been considering Cruzer’s by Evolv or a pair of Allbirds Tree Skippers. I doubt either pair would be able to withstand a skateboard’s abuse. That’s okay. I’m concerned that the Evolv may not look well with casual jeans. I’m also concerned about the Allbirds durability.

minimalism,How I Learned to Live without Toilet Paper,"Background: family and I lived in a camper for two years due to love of travel and traveling for work. For anyone who’s ever spent time in a camper, you come to realize that all that tp can be hell on a septic tank. 

We tried simply tossing the tp in a garbage bag but that (a) creates MORE waste and (b) is grossness to the max. 

So, we switched to a “lota” (pronounced low-tah). Being that my SO is from a third-world country, he was down with it and saving $50/month on something we just wipe our butts with and toss anyway. 

A lota is a container which holds water. You keep  this container in the bathroom and, after you do your business, you clean yourself with it. We bought a $1 sports bottle (the squirty kind) from Walmart and just use that after we’re done. Then we keep a designated towel on the tp roll holder and just use that to lightly pat our posteriors. 

And no, you don’t always have to touch your dirty bum-bum. Often the pressure of the squirting water eliminates the cling-ons. However, for those messy days, it doesn’t hurt to get down there for a quick inspection. It is YOUR body after all and you can always scrub your hands afterwards with a nail brush (especially if you keep long nails). 

Plus, you’ll notice less of a “foo-foo” smell throughout the day because of how you refresh your areas every time you go make-make. 

Granted, it’s not for everyone, but this saved us at least $600/year and freed us from the tyranny of the vicious tp cycle. 

Hope this helps anybody out there looking to save money or just reduce the amount of stuff you have to buy.

Couldn’t fit another thing comfortable if I wanted too. Also I feel like men wearing those bags I feel uncomfortable sometime or when I flip it around. I use a normal backpack more it’s able to fit all my stuff. Especially with school starting, I might just get a tad smaller of a backpack and edc it all the time for school and outdoor activities. Even if I were to keep the sling pack it would sit there and collect dust kinda like it has. 

Time to get rid of it?? I’m glad though I tried it out and gave it a chance for use . I know their becoming in style in stuff a little more for females and some men but yeah

minimalism,Decision fatigue - while shopping,"I’ve always been super confused as a person while shopping for anything. I try to make sure I really do love and/or need the things I buy, but lately I have been focusing on buying good quality stuff I can use for longer. As a college student, my budgets are often low as well. Unfortunately, it has been quite exhausting for me to make sure I buy the right thing. I replaced some stuff recently and it was painful because I kept rethinking my decisions and kept compulsively trying to make sure I’m getting the right product for my budget. I kept comparing brands/quality/cost and it led to me returning and exchanging products a lot more often than I normally do, still unsure of whether I’m doing the right thing.

minimalism,How to do this with 3 kids?," 

I’ve recently discovered that what I’m doing for years now is called minimalism. It all started when I moved a lot, I realised that it is easier to move if you own less stuff and since I’m a little bit of a neat freak it is way easier to keep my room tidy if I own less things. When we had our first child a lot of stuff appeared, we bought everything which we were advised, you can imagine, in our 1 bedroom flat we could go to bed after we rearranged some furniture otherwise it wasn’t possible. Fast forward a couple of years we moved into a house, now we have 3 kids, 6 years old, 3 years old and a 6 months old. I’m totally invested with having just the essential in our lives but it is difficult with kids. They don’t understand this and they shouldn’t also, they don’t get the quality over quantity idea too and even though we discussed with relatives that they don’t buy them things before checking with us it is not happening. My wife also not the biggest fan of a small closet, she is trying and I think she is doing good.

My main question is can somebody give me advice or some good tips how to do this with kids? Because when I watch minimalist yt videos I’m just laughing, solo people brag about how few things they own and how minimalistic their apartment is, try this with a partner or even with 1 kid.

To be honest we are still miles ahead of people surrounding us. We live in a block with 8 of the same houses and we all have a garage. We are the only one with 3 kids and we are the only one who can fit our car into the garage, everyone else is having junk there, it is not even close, and also the loft, we don’t put there anything while the others put stuff there.

TLDR, we have 3 kids, trying to own less to have a de-cluttered life, how I can manage this with kids? They get so many stuff from relatives and their room is really crowded.",2019-08-17 21:41:40,31,13
minimalism,I hate picture frames?,"I’ve noticed over the past few years how much I hate hanging up picture frames. I’ve collected a bunch over the years because I wanted to do a cute gallery wall like I see on Pinterest, but I’m never satisfied with it. I’ve got lots of cool paper goods and posters but I just end up keeping them in a box that I like to go through every so often.

Hanging frames on walls just seems so unnecessary? I have a couple of wire wall grids from Amazon that I use to clip stuff on. It’s pretty cute but not as mature looking as a gallery wall. But it’s much easier to manage than finding frames to fit everything I might want to display.!

I have OCD, and I’m wondering if hanging things is one of my triggers? It just feels so permanent and like I have no control over the item hanging on the wall.

Should I get over it/grow up, or should I donate all of my picture frames? Does anyone else feel this way? Is having bare walls weird?",2019-08-17 21:24:02,9,6

minimalism,Minimalist struggles online...,"Feeling a great struggle to declutter online life... Being forced at work to use crazy fast online communication tools like Slack to keep up with what's happening is super irritating for a minimalist!

I don't freaking want to keep getting distracted with thousands of notifications each day!

Colleagues don't think twice before posting anything in a Slack channel because its a chat room so why not talk about the last vacation or why not post a funny GIF (not funny by the way)?

I have started blaming individuals for this nonsense and I have discovered that forcing discipline in an informal environment never ever works! Think of this like someone walks at a party and tells people to pull up their laptops and start working! they might listen for like 5 minutes and then ""Here we go again!"" the same damn thing happens again!

I eventually I got sick and tired and I have started looking for a productivity tool for minimalists that I could probably implement at work but there was basically none on the marketplace! All you can find is complex user interfaces, notifications all day long and worst of all tools with chatrooms.

as I am a web developer, I pulled up my laptop and I started coding...codding to shape my idea of  what a  time/project management  software of a minimalists cloud look like  & [raya.io](https://raya.io) was born... the story has so much to it and I have already covered more details on Medium:  [Why I ditched Slack & Asana and I created my own minimalist software?](https://medium.com/@hamedbaatour/why-i-ditched-slack-asana-and-i-created-my-own-minimalist-software-516c4d155cbf)

but to wrap up here I think there a couple of takeaways for my fellow minimalists:

\- Being a minimalist is about fighting to make others respect your time which is your most valuable asset

\- If you don't create a clutter free and organized environment in the first place people's behavior will default to a total mess! (  and it is very hard to fight it )

\- Complaining works only short term and I really mean short term (like 5 minutes) and the old bad habits will dominate after that! and the only way to break them is to change the environment.

I hope sharing this point be a meaningful contribution to this forum.

minimalism,Anyone else spend more while depressed,"When i'm depressed I get a mindset where I stop thinking about the future and I just don't care which leads to stress spending. It also leads to stress eating which is equally unhealthy yet unrelated (except for the money I spend to stress eat).  

I already have a problem with over consumerism and consumer debt.  I am trying to be good and minamalism and purposeful living has helped me cut back greatly. I still want things and obsess over them I just have more control.  I'll give you an example.  I would love to build a new gaming and production PC,  my current PC is far more than enough. It was top of the line and cost me upwards of $2,000 new in 2015.  Today it's still a beast but reselling the components would only net me around $650, so it's just worth it to just keep what I have.  A new PC would cost me over $3,000 and would be so overkill that it just wouldn't be necessary dollar for dollar.  Now my logical brain knows this and I can part out the new computer in my head realise its absurd and unnecessary and be satisfied with what I have.  However when I get depressed it's like my plan goes away and I just.. think what does it matter.  Spend $4k on a pc. Go further into debt at least you'll be happy with the new stuff.   Basically when I'm depressed my brain has an increased desire for instant gratification no matter the cost. But I know I won't truly be happy and the debt is worse than the temporary fix of buying something.  

Honestly this is more of a release than a question.  I'm clearly depressed right now and in the dark mindset and typing out my thoughts apparently helps. Sorry for using this platform for therapy.

minimalism,About Gifts,"Good morning (or evening, or afternoon, wherever you are)! I figured this would be a good place to go for advice, as I don't personally really know anyone who desires to follow minimalism. My parents, siblings, and in-laws can, for the most part, be considered packrats. If this is not an appropriate place for this or if it's been covered before, feel free to kick my post.

My question pertains to that of giving gifts. I really struggle with giving gifts. It's hard for me to receive gifts, mostly because I don't really like to keep a lot of things around and try to get by only with what I need and really, REALLY want, which isn't a ton (at least, I think so). Gifts, I feel, have almost become a formality, a robotic procedure to recognize a particular day or person. When I give a gift, I REALLY want it to be useful or really meaningful to the person receiving it. I would rather *not* give someone a gift than give a gift that feels impersonal or procedural; however, I know others do not always feel this way. I have tried to think of activities and experiences to gift instead but often I come up short.

When I am given a gift, I often feel guilty for not using/appreciating it very much. I really appreciate the gesture! I love the act of kindness But often, I feel like I keep it around solely to appease the giver. I do not want someone to feel this discomfort when I give a gift that is... mechanical, if that makes sense. Additionally, I and most of my loved ones are at a station in life where if they need/want something, they take care of it themselves. The other, less fortunate of my circle, I really enjoy giving useful, practical gifts or something they really, really desire but are unable to acquire easily on their own.

I suppose I'm asking this: is it inconsiderate of me to not give a lot of gifts that are impersonal, instead focusing on occasional gifts that are well-planned and personal to both me and the recipient? I would much rather give few very meaningful gifts over a lifetime--especially to my loved ones who collect and keep everything they are given and never use it except to collect dust!

Are there apps that help manage scanned paper?  Free is good, but I would pay for a quality service.

\-Go through each category of my collection every 2-3 months and see what is excessive and what is truly worth keeping to up my makeup game. 

\-If I have my eye on something I want to add to my collection or try out, I make my self wait and evaluate how it could enhance my collection. i.e. do I have anything else similar? Is this groundbreaking? How often would I use this?

minimalism,My cell phone reception has never been worse (and I love it),"For years I had Verizon, and I was paying $135 just for my own unlimited phone plan. I also was spending ridiculously, deep in debt, incredibly unhealthy, and fairly miserable. The phone bill was just one of many ""Quality of Life"" expenses I justified because ""I deserved it"", ""everyone else is doing it"", and it kept me distracted and scattered enough to never really have to focus on anything in my life. This applied to physical minimalism as well. If I owned enough stuff and kept my life chaotic enough, I could never adequately focus on the mental health and personal choices that were keeping me stuck in a life that didn't satisfy me. I couldn't think about existential ennui if my laundry pile was taller than my head. The concept of simplifying my life scared me, because then I would actually be accountable to the ways I was living out of alignment with my values.

I made some significant changes. I quit a high stress job that was keeping me extremely sick and busy and angry for a less prestigious position. I put a complete shopping ban on all unnecessary purchases that were cluttering up my psyche for a quick dopamine hit. And most importantly, I became single-mindedly devoted to paying off all of my student loans, car note, collections debt, etc. Looking back I'm absolutely flabbergasted at how much money was just being siphoned out of my account because of laziness, impulse, jealousy, stress, etc. Which leads me to my phone plan, which was one of the last things to go.

I decided that now that I'm out of debt, I'm going to save up and travel for a whole year, starting next Spring. Keep in mind, I don't make that much money, but it's amazing what you can save when you downsize, simplify, and really look at those patterns that keep you stuck. I took on a second job to save enough by the time I want to leave, and took a scalpel to my expenses. Daily (or twice daily) Starbucks runs? Nope. The latest tech? I've had my phone for 3 years. Ridiculously overpriced cellphone plan? Nah. 

I'm now prepaid, paying $50 a month, and guess what? The service is *wayyy* shittier! It's not necessarily bad, but compared to the insanely expensive plan I was on, I now have videos crash. Or podcasts won't load. It takes a while to download something. And that's *okay.* I don't get mad anymore because I'm not as desperate to escape from a chaotic life I'm no longer enjoying. I can sit in a waiting line or in traffic with silence. It's okay now. And that's a really good feeling.",2019-08-15 04:45:46,15,60

minimalism,More funiture for less,A long time I only slept on the ground on my matress. Then I thought about how to minimize a little more in my room.I have this bookshelf not full but with things and I thought I could throw it out. I figured I couldnt because I dont want to lay things on the ground like office stuff or so. But then I had an idea. I build a bed (and may I say its a pretty nice design and I never build anything before and it looks really good and is stable and still standing) high enough to have some storage under it. I am thinking about wooden boxes to put under there what takes away like maybe a third of the space under my bed an then when I move out one day I can hide. Vacuumcleaner and stuff like that on the other side. The Bed turned out good and I even build a dinning table because I dont want my desk anymore with the two containers on the sides. So I had to find a way to fit everything from my bookshelf and my containers under my bed. Right now it looks really good. Everything fits under there I only have to build the boxes. And this my friends is the story on how I build a bed that eleminates a bookshelf and two desk containers. I only have to throw it out now but its really heavy.,2019-08-15 02:27:59,1,0
minimalism,Foraging Weeks,"This is a new exercise for me. But I think it's going well, so I decided to share it. There's a heavy frugality strain here, but these concepts are also related to one another. 

A few days ago, I decided to try and follow two rules for as long as possible: 

(1) Outside of things like rent, bills, etc., only use cash.

(2) Don't withdraw any money from the bank. 

This leads to a number of happy consequences: 

(1) You immediately flense inessentials from your life. You stop consuming superfluous goods and services. The surplus things that are lying around your house --- old computers, unplayed records, etc. --- get sold. You are immediately aware that there is a hierarchy of attachment to things in your life, and you start eliminating the ones at the bottom. 

* I'm firmly convinced that working 6 months in a job selling old shit will disillusion anyone with commodity fetishism. That's a side effect here. 

(2) You become more resourceful. You learn to wash and reuse, instead of simply consuming and discarding. And disciplined, too. (e.g., you leave a little early and take public transit, instead of being lazy and paying for a cab.) Applications of skill and labor are often cheaper than the alternatives, so you learn to cook. To build. To mend and reuse and rehome and...

(3) You end up with more money. Which, in this economy, means more freedom. Freedom to (say) eat muffins on the beach while devouring a good book, or spend quiet nights at home with your family, or do whatever else it is that animates you. 

Been a few days, so far. Hopefully I can keep it going.",2019-08-14 23:09:31,8,20

Now, I am at half of what I used to spend on my devices and reached a point where I limit my self to **25 minutes** a day on the apps I was spending to much time.

I was spending upwards of *6 hours to 10 hours a day* and now the average is around *3 hours* in the worst case scenario. The objectives are still the same, and I will keep with the challenge. I will continue to update, but right now I feel tremendously better with less angry and/or irritable moments plus I have experimented a huge revamp on productivity and health (specially being consistent on going to the GYM and drinking water) both physically and mentally.

minimalism,"I’m a previous fashion-obsessed shopaholic recently converted to ethical fashion and minimalism. How can I adjust from here, materialistically and socially?","Hey, so I just joined this subreddit and I’m not sure about what I should do in terms of my closet. I have an easier time understanding that home decor is not a necessity and have cut that spending entirely, but clothing is another story. My three main issues as of right now are:

1) Should I be paring my clothing down to things I know I wear regularly and save additional pieces for occasions or keep what I already own and slowly accumulate more pieces as a collection? 

2) Will the field I will be going into conflict with my new beliefs, and will others in that environment react to it poorly to a point of impacting my opportunities?

3) Since I’m in university and I am surrounded by VERY materialistic people (I’m in school for essentially fashion sales) will my peers be too off-put to want to interact with me? Has anyone had any experiences or can tell me what to expect?

When I say that it will have a social impact, I don’t mean that I will become ‘preachy’ to others necessarily, but I don’t want to pretend like I enjoy things that I don’t (like Gucci, for example) that my classmates idolize to an extent more than most. I disagree with the concept of capitalist-based social hierarchy and I think that expensive brands create division between economic and social classes and perpetuate the devaluation of other human beings for not owning (or caring about) expensive clothing or wearing shiny rocks. Normally people would just switch where they buy items from without too much of a thought, but since fashion was essentially a huge part of my identity and actually impacted **what I chose to go far into debt into to study in college** its a big deal to me and I feel very very lost right now.

I’m very concerned for where my future is going because I am at a moral conflict of interest with my career and personal morals. Most of the companies that I would be potentially working for within my region have received low ratings from ethical shopping scale sites for many reasons. I don’t know what to do with my career now that I’ve woken up to become less greedy and selfish.

If anyone has anything to comment, please don’t hold anything back. I’m just sort of ranting and trying to figure myself out through this post, and since fashion was always part of my identity and designer fashion was all I strived for I’m trying to reconcile with this new version of myself and writing it all out helps.

minimalism,At ease with medical condition because of minimalism,"I'll premise this by saying that spending 2 months in the hospital really gave me a sense of what it could be like to live super minimally.

I have an ileostomy and it's a little pouch attached to the side of my abdomen to collect waste. I even let go of my colon because I felt like it didn't bring value to my life. Soon I'll even be letting go of my bum hole, super hardcore minimalism right? Who needs toilet paper anyway? All jokes aside, minimalism has helped me tremendously when trying to cope with the loss of my colon and surviving Ulcerative Colitis. Living in a hospital bed with basically nothing but my glasses and my phone felt so sterile. Practically zero belongings, no extraneous things in the room, and all my nutrition fed via tubes. It could even be the goal of some cult like minimalism that we see parodies of online. But the experience really made me think about what brings value and convenience to my life - essentialism/minimalism really helped me to get my life back on track after this fiasco.

After almost dying in the hospital, the surgery really gave me a second chance at life. Through minimalism, I've tried to be more deliberate and purposeful each day and it really has brought satisfaction and peace to my mind. It's not austere or strict minimalism either.

minimalism,I messed up...,"So, one of the professors at my university who I am close with is in the process of moving to another country. She asked me to catsit for a total of 3 days, which I happily did. I was not expecting anything at all in return. On my last day, there was a bag with a note on top saying thank you, this is for you. But, this is where I got confused, the bag had some things that were clearly for me, a pair of earrings, a book and a watercolor painting, but then there were other things that looked like clothes ready to be donated (very dated/ ugly items). And so I got confused if the whole bag was for me, or if she just placed my gift on top of the bag (again, he whole house is in chaos as they are trying to move to another country). So I was super conflicted and decided to just take the things I would use/ felt like they were for me and I left the clothes behind. Welllllll my professor just got home and called me and asked if I saw the bag and I said I did and thanked her for the earrings and watercolor and book. Then she asked if I saw the clothes and I realized my error immediately. And so I just said oh I am a minimalist and felt like I didn’t need any more clothes right now, and that someone else might love them more than me (I really thought they were just clothes she was trying to get rid of before the move, because she has been trying to give me clothes for a while... ) and then she tells me that she bought those leggings just for me.... oh man.... I messed up big time and feel like crap. I mean it was fine and we moved the conversation to other things, but, I dunno...Feels awful. Should I have just taken everything and then donated?

minimalism,"Premature replacements, branding, and shopping bans","I’m trying to adopt a more minimalist life because it truly makes me happy. I have not gone on an all-out decluttering mode, but I slowly get rid of stuff that I don’t use/like and try to buy better alternatives if needed. 

I also keep a list of things I might want a better replacement of or things that I want to invest in so that if I come across a good deal and quality I could buy it without actively seeking for it. I did however go on a bit of a spree this month because I’m on an extended vacation. I didn’t buy stuff I didn’t need, but I did cross off everything off my list.

I don’t regret any of my purchases, but I did find myself replacing things that I could have extended the use of for some more time - I would have bought the replacement eventually, but perhaps I didn’t need to just yet? Have you experienced this? How did you handle/justify it?

To be honest I still feel like indulging some more and buying name brand stuff I‘ll get for cheaper here on vacation, but I could get alternatives for cheaper back home (I’m still struggling with the whole ‘brand’ thing having grown up in a home where brands were considered superior).

I am definitely planning on a 6 month or yearlong shopping ban for myself (once I head back?) but I also wanted to know when you guys made exceptions so I’m not unreasonable restrictive.",2019-08-08 21:16:02,8,3

minimalism,Spending is triggered by shame,"No advertising campaign for fashionable clothing would work if nobody would make fun of the badly dressed girl. 

Nobody would buy expensive cars if not for people's envy.

Nobody would spend money on a house they can barely afford if the term ""trailer trash"" wouldn't go around.

My boyfriend told me a story today about his mom and how she's trying to keep up with the Joneses but she can't. 

The Joneses being a group of ""friends"" who are well off financially. Have expensive cars, expensive homes, and travel often. Worse, they always treated my bf's mom with some sort of ""um nothing you do impresses us because is not expensive enough"".

What makes matters worse is that they are bad people. They are basically a group of friends who sleep with each others' wives, some of then were involved with underage prostitutes, etc. Their kids have similar values. The men work a lot to impress and the women are attention-whoring on Instagram while traveling to ""discover themselves"".

My point is at, at the end of the day, we have to accept that shame plays a role into why we want more things in our lives.

Things that don't make sense, extra hours that kill our happiness and health, only wanting to get admired by others and increase our social status.

The friends you pick matter a lot, don't let anyone make you feel inferior because of how much you earn, where you went to college ( if you went to college) and what house and what car you own.

I think once you get that of the way, life becomes a little bit less cluttered.



EDIT: for those who believe shame has absolutely nothing to do with buying stuff for the sake of buying stuff

minimalism,Tip: View everything in terms of monthly cost.,"If you are like me, you can't stand running costs and subscriptions or at least try to avoid them. I am very careful in committing to a subscription, even if it is relatively low cost and arguably good value.

With material possessions I have always been more liberal with spending money, because after all it just hurts once and then I own the thing forever. Sadly nothing is permanent and everything falls apart and needs replacements or entices you to upgrade. If I buy an iPad for instance I will upgrade it after a few years. The same is true for my computer, my smartphone, my kindle etc.

Depending on how long I keep these gadgets they cost me time, space, attention and a few bucks a month. When I think of the costs in terms of monthly cost, it effectively reduces my desire to buy these things. A smartphone might cost 10$ a month, an iPad 7$, a PC 11$ etc. It makes my feel depended, it is almost like a loan I have to pay off.

It also helps to think if I really want to introduce a new costly category in my life. A good example is Regaine. When you start losing your hair as a man you inform yourself about the options and you will stumble upon Regaine. It's basically a foam you have to massage into your head every day. When I started to lose hair I bought myself a can. After a while it dawned on me: 

*""Do I really want to spend those 20 bucks a month (or whatever) on this product for the rest of my life? Fuck no, I don't want this dependency .""*

There are things that are unavoidable. I need to change my tooth brush regularly and buy toothpaste. But do I really want to start putting some face cream on every day? Maybe, but if so I have to be aware that it will cost me e.g. 10$ a month for basically the rest of my life.
Same with gadgets: Every gadget I introduce (smartwatches, tablets, smart speakers etc.) will have to be replaced regularly and is effectively a recurring cost. 


PS: Buying a new shoe for instance is not a new category, because I need shoes anyway and a second pair of shoes will increase the life span of the shoes I already have. Also there are some things that really last a life time without the need of service if you take care of them, like a good pair of binoculars. But such things really are an exception. 

It's also important to keep related costs in mind. When you buy an iPad, you will also buy apps, maybe dongles, accessories etc.

minimalism,Not confusing minimalism with dependence on others.,"Was thinking about this today.

If you are on a road-trip across multiple states/provinces and experience a situation requiring a battery boost, is it better to be carrying a AAA membership card or a pair of jumper cables and/or a battery booster pack? What about a flat tire situation? A card that weighs less than an ounce and barely takes any space in your glovebox, or a tire repair kit that includes plugs, reamer, awl, and air compressor?

I’ve been dealing with this struggle between minimalism and self-reliance since I started getting rid of things. Is it practical to give away my printer if it means having to go to the library for printing tasks, which happen maybe 3 times a year? It is if the toner is running low and I can’t afford to buy a new one or a refill. Is it practical to toss away my first aid kit if I live a block away from a hospital with a large ER? Do I want to walk to the hospital every time I need a bandage or need to disinfect a wound?

I could live out of a backpack and call myself “free”, but is it really freedom if I’m actually just staying in a friends’ spare bedroom long-term, not paying any rent, and labelling it “vagabonding?”

A big, almost spiritual, component of minimalism to me is not only eliminating a certain thing from your life, but all eliminating your dependence on it. This isn’t always possible to do since we are all slaves to our body’s desire to survive, and pursue things that make than end achievable more efficiently and effectively. But, a lot of so called needs can be eliminated on a deeper level.

minimalism,Christmas - planning ahead,"Hello everyone,

I try to live a minimalistic lifestyle, not perfect in any way, but getting better daily. My mom has hoarding tendencies - she can't get rid of anything and buys things ""just in case."" Due to growing up this way, minimalism has really appealed to me. Clutter really bothers me so I keep my home clutter free and as organized as possible. My husband and I have a Christmas baby so we will be celebrating his first birthday and his first Christmas at the same time. Inhave two siblings. Growing up Christmas was so over the top with the number of gifts each person received - I'm talking 50+ gifts per person just from my parents (really from my mom as she does all of the shopping). The number of gifts made it so we couldn't even walk into the family room because the gifts were overflowing into the hallway. My siblings and I have asked our mom every year since we have been adults to please scale back and buy us less. To some degree she has, but even last year my husband and I couldn't fit all of our Christmas gifts into our jeep to bring home and had to make a second trip. 

Yesterday we were organizing my husbands closet and donating clothes he doesn't wear any more and we came across a huge gift bag of items we received for Christmas and never even opened. This really made me start wondering how to deal with the excess holiday gifts this year. We are both concerned that our son is going to receive countless gifts between his birthday and Christmas (he also has 2 other sets of grandparents that spoil him, but my mom is the worst offender), the gifts are going to clutter our home, and he truly won't enjoy the gifts because there wil be an overwhelming amount. 

Of note, my mom also buys quantity over quality. In the past few years she has bought be shoes that were a full size too big because she found them on sale and they didn't have my size, an xlarge jacket when at the time I wore a medium, and countless cheap gifts that we will never use. She enjoys giving gifts, it makes her happy, but I don't enjoy being on the receiving end of it. 

I have mentioned to her several times already that we would like to keep Christmas small so our son can enjoy the gifts he received and can learn that holidays are about spending time together as a family, not about material possessions. I just highly doubt this is going to change her mind on the gifts she is going to give. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? My sister (who has a son the same age as ours) and I thought about implementing a rule that she can gift a max of 4 items to us and our kids (something they want, something they need, something to wear, something to read). Is this inappropriate or completely out of line for us to suggest?

Thanks for the recommendations!",2019-08-07 16:56:53,13,10

minimalism,Three Rules That Revitalized My Minimalism [lifestyle],"As everyone on this subreddit has discovered in their own journey of minimalism, one person’s path is likely to differ from someone else’s - and that’s perfectly good and healthy. I’d like to share the three rules that I’ve learned for myself: if they can help you on your path, I hope you’ll consider them as well.

**Rule #1: Minimalism is about eliminating waste, not necessarily redundancy.** I’ve learned over time that *the only redundancy that needs to be minimized is that which is wasteful - the things that we have that truly don’t add value because having multiples of the object serves no purpose.* You’re going to find things that you like having redundancy in and that’s perfectly okay. Keep the redundant items if they’re adding value. And if they later stop adding value, then you can eliminate them at that time.

**Rule #2: Minimalism is not the same as frugality.** Minimalism affords us the ability have the ultimate level of frugality - not spending money on the things that don’t matter. But consequently, that also means that *we have a lot more money left over to spend on the things that truly add value, allowing us to have the best of the things that really matter.* “Downsizing” in many areas of life allows for “upsizing” in the important areas.

**Rule #3: Minimalism ends with decluttering - it begins when shopping.** A lot of people start the minimalism journey by getting rid of the items they already have in their life. But often times, people declutter to make room for new items, entirely negating any progress. Avoid this trap by focusing on *becoming more intentional with your spending, and reducing the new items coming into your life first.* Then it’ll be easier to not replace old items when they leave your space.",2019-08-05 15:53:40,20,339

I know, I will live in houses so I don't need much, but still, I feel amazing! I weight my backpack to see how many kilos are going to be on my shoulders, it was 3 kilos!

1 long pair of green trousers (they were in the backpack while weighting it)

1 pink tank top

1 black tank top

1 black T-shirt

1 black T-shirt from my bf's band for the house

I am going to have a great time, not walking with so much weight (arrgh except my cat because she is a bit fatty-but she is totally worth it), and not worrying if all my stuff are in the suitcase,  not stretching out my hands/body all the time because of the weight, not having someone else help me with my stuff! I feel in control!

minimalism,"""Shop"" outdoors for decor supplies","I recently moved and have realized that using nature items that have fallen to the ground make great decor for minimalists.

 In fact, out of all the trunkloads of stuff I donated before the move, the one thing I got teary eyed over giving up was a sprawling tree limb I had to leave in the backyard because there was no space for it in my smaller new home.

My husband has these huge, heavy frames with prints inside he insists on keeping.  But I'd rather endure the strenuous and stressful work of moving with organic materials: tree branches, dried flowers, wheat, straw, burlap strips, pine cones, rocks, leaves, tree bark, even pits from peaches and avocados.

Not only are they lightweight, but if you decide not to bring them along, simply return them to nature and find new ones where your current home is. It's what animals do, right?!

Nature items give a basic home rustic, witchy, serene style. No bulk, no possessiveness, no clutter.",2019-08-04 18:41:36,11,17
minimalism,Everyone is being negative about my choice to move towards minimalism!!,"I don’t know how to remove “Art and Design” from here.

I don’t need their support. They didn’t support when I became vegan years ago. Even today my mom repeatedly kept saying I needed to add chicken to my meal. I’m 27. I live out of state. I only call her once a month.  Today I shared (because she asked me to donate to a girl in her neighborhood who needed clothes) that I moved down to a capsule wardrobe and she basically mocked my choices. And says the real reason I’m doing this is because I don’t know how to “Manage money and This town I live in has white people persuading me to do weird stuff”.   My partner is white and he did not influence this. Why can’t I decide something for myself! I’m an adult! So frustrating! 

Anyway felt much better after getting rid of so many clothes. Plan to clean up other areas of my life and space as well. Like Tupperware (not sustainable I know) silverware makeup etc.

minimalism,How to bring minimalism into your second home?,"Sorry if the title is confusing, but I have been living alone with my husband for three years. We lived in a tiny house for two years and were very minimal. I’ve always had my room in my parents house, and this is what I mean by “second home”.

Just last week we moved back to California from a year abroad in Japan. In Japan, we hardly had any things, and only about 15 pieces of clothing each.

However, we moved back to my parents’ house, and my old room has a lot of things. I’m having a hard time getting rid of many things (clothes that don’t fit because I’m not as thin anymore, for example).

It doesn’t make sense that I have gone three years without needing these things, and yet I’m having a hard time letting go. I’m not much of a sentimental person, but I find some things useful, albeit not at this moment (kitchenware but don’t have my own kitchen right now).

I don’t plan to move out until I finish grad school in two years, so I wonder if I should get rid of my items, when in two years I’ll need to use them again?

I’ve been anxious with all the stuff I have in my room, and am feeling stuck. :(",2019-08-04 08:30:59,3,3

minimalism,I'm selling my Smartwatch.,"It was an impulse purchase, honestly. I spent quite some money on a Smartwatch a few months ago. It was a mistake.

I told myself it'd be useful to track my steps... and also it looks absolutely beautiful. But if I'm being honest with myself, I hardly ever use any of the features the watch comes with.

I could have totally done with a simple fitness tracker for like €30.

So I put the watch on Ebay to sell it to someone who will get more use out of it than I did.

I guess my point with this post is to not beat yourself up over an impulse purchase you made. The money won't come back to you if you keep the item. If you still can, return it. If you can't, sell it and make at least some of the money back.

What I learned from this is that I will overthink my future purchases even more.",2019-08-04 04:31:10,19,61
minimalism,I think my maternity wardrobe is an accidental capsule wardrobe.,"As a first time mom, I have been building a small wardrobe of maternity clothes, but because our baby budget is so tight, I have to be very mindful of what I spend money on. So for the next several months of pregnancy, what I have is this:

- 2 pairs black scrub pants (workwear)
- 5 black scrub tops (workwear)
- 1 pair black maternity leggings
- 2 pairs maternity jeans
- 6 maternity t shirts (2 black, 1 grey, 1 white, 1 navy, 1 B&W striped, 1 floral) 
- 1 gray cardigan
- 1 blue cardigan 
- 2 button up flannels 
- 2 maternity dresses
- 1 pair athletic shoes
- 1 pair nude flats
- 1 pair white slip on Vans 

I also obviously have socks, underwear, a couple of pairs of sweats and T-shirt’s to sleep in, and some basic winter gear (coat, hat, and gloves), but suddenly being so limited in what is comfortable and what fits my changing body has made me realize how unnecessary the bulk of my regular wardrobe is.

minimalism,Transitioning to minimalism has made me unappreciative of gifts,"I’ve been decluttering for a month now, reducing my items. My family is on the hoarderish side, with the impulse buying tendencies included. We have clothes and random items of boxes that rise to the ceiling and stored all over the house (kitchen, my dad’s and siblings’ closets, under my bed etc.). So growing up with hardly enough space to walk within the house, minimalism sounded very appealing to me and I started reducing my belongings. I respect that my family does not want to do the same when I suggested the idea. 

However, I’ve had several experiences where a family member gives me a physical gift, and I feel irked instead of thankful. And that just sounds horrible thinking about it. I got irked at receiving a sweater when I live in a tropical place. I got irked when I received a keychain from a country my relative visited. I got irked when my sibling got me a pop funko figurine when it was his collecting hobby, not mine. And it just sounds so horrible to think that I really don’t want the presents that they give. I have already gently mentioned that I would prefer experiences with them, spending time with them than material gifts, but since I’ve noticed that gift-giving is their language of love, most of them were offended and called me ungrateful, which at this point, I somewhat agree with. 

Is there anyone else who has experienced this or is currently experiencing it?",2019-08-03 16:24:22,19,55

minimalism,Minimalism landed me in therapy,"I've been super into minimalism for the past 5 years, during which time I have diligently curated my life to spark joy. I've decluttered everything: clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories, toiletries, makeup, books, household objects, sentimental items, kitchenware, food/pantry, tech gadgets, my to do list, emails, social media, online accounts, loyalty programs, subscription services, finances, investments, hobbies, my reading list, work goals, and even relationships.

Being able to run most of my life & work with only my smartphone & laptop has removed the need for a countless number of items: camera, video camera, scanner, fax, printer, desktop computer, monitor, wireless keyboard/mouse, tablet, webcam, speakers, thumb drive, landline phone, flashlight, calculator, clock, alarm, checkbook, gps, watch, timer, calendar, dayplanner, travel document organizer, address book, notebooks, filing cabinet, office supplies, desk, desk chair, physical books, Kindle reader, bookshelves, CDs, CD player, mp3 player, DVDs, DVD player, physical photos, photo albums, TV, TV stand, modem (I use my phone data), and router.

I've streamlined my daily habits, diet, meal prep, and exercise into a routine I feel great about. I digitized all my papers & photos and live paperfree. Housework, dishes, and laundry are easy to keep up with since I downsized to a tiny apartment and don't own much stuff to clean or maintain. I gave my car to my brother and live carfree. I only read books and watch shows/movies that I'm super excited for. My travel list is whittled down only to places I truly want to visit. I spend my time with my closest friends and family. I've cut down on expenses enough that I don't need much money to live on and could be financially independent. I've even started to let go of old ideas, preconceptions, and goals that were no longer serving me. 

I'm finally at a place in my life where I genuinely don't have anything left to declutter.

And now... all the distractions are gone. 

No broken items to fix. No purchases to return. No closets to organize. No clothes to dry clean. No extensive beauty routine to take up my mornings. No car to maintain. No junk emails to sift through. No random meetings to suffer through.

I have had the time & space to think deeply about who I am, how I got here, and most importantly, about what it is I want to do with my ""one wild and precious life."" 

And to do that, I came to the surprising realization that I need help processing some scary stuff from my past in order to address some current negative emotions (anxiety, overwhelm) and self-sabotaging behaviors (procrastination, withdrawal). I need support in making good choices and maintaining good habits for my health, career, and relationships.

So, I had my first therapy appointment yesterday. Of course, nothing is different after just one session, but everything is different. The burden feels lifted. I hit it off with my therapist, and now I don't feel like I have to work through my issues alone anymore. I'm getting the help that frankly I should have sought out 10 years ago.

I'm not saying that everyone needs to create a capsule wardrobe before they can seek help, but it was an important part of the process for me. I'm grateful to minimalism for helping me to get rid of the distractions so that I can focus on what's truly important: my health, wellness, and loved ones.

Now I actually have kids and I realize that they have their own interests, and are not as absorbed with reading as I was (although they are still pretty young), and that when it comes to the classics, it will be just as convenient to get ebooks or even library books as it would be to keep the copies I read as a kid.  My son also has a developmental disability and I need to accept that he he may or may not even learn to read. Currently half my garage is full of old books and its just not going to work living around them as though one day they will have their long awaited moment of glory.  I really don't want to move to a bigger house in order to keep this up which my husband keeps suggesting every time the book storage issue comes up.  I work full time and barely have time to read new material in line with my current interests much less boxes on boxes of childhood nostalgia.

I definitely believe that these books need to go, but accepting the loss of my illusions about them is so hard.

Granted, you don't always immediately find what you might be looking for but I appreciate my bread bin so much more than I probably would have if I had just bought a new one somewhere.

We wanted to do a community spotlight feature for /r/ZeroWaste, a subreddit of subscribers dedicated to minimizing their overall environmental impact. Zero Waste is a set of principles focused on waste prevention that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused. The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills, incinerators, or the ocean. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_waste))

The beautiful thing about zero waste is that it naturally supports being minimalist. If you buy and use less, you're demanding less of the economy and putting less strain on the environment by recycling and reusing. Here's a great blog post [on the similarities](https://treadingmyownpath.com/2015/04/08/can-you-be-zero-waste-and-a-minimalist/) between both communities / lifestyles if you're inclined to read more about it!

minimalism,Unsure wether to sell / throw away / keep.,"Hi all,

I've been a minimalists for the last \~5 years. I've cleaned the house pretty well and I do not poses things that do not enrich my life.... except a few things that is perhaps.

&#x200B;

I've got a bunch of Pokémon merchendise I got years ago. Some stuff are not even possible to buy anymore. It's rare, extremely rare so to say. Though that doesn't mean it brings up good money as I checked some prices unfortunately.

&#x200B;

I am kind of afraid of doing them away - with fear I will regret it and not being able to buy them again. But I've had them for 5-15 years already.

&#x200B;

I come at the point where I need to decide wether I want to sell (for just a few bucks) / throw away or keep it. Personally I do not think I can keep it much in my life any longer, because women might think it's childish or weird. It's like walking in to someone's bedroom and see a few pop figures on the shelves.

We did a huge purge of our living room and I was hooked! But I'm really struggling with paring down other areas.


I'd say clothes are about 70% of the problem. There are piles of them (clean and dirty) in just about every part of our house. I went through a shopping phase (poor coping mechanism for stress) and have a truly outrageous amount of clothes. I can go months and months without doing laundry. Of course, this leads to an insurmountable amount of laundry that never gets done.


I really want to cut back, but the problem is most of my clothes are really nice and I wear and enjoy them. But, we have a small house and small closets. I ended up turning a small room into another closet, and it still feels like we don't have enough room for all of our clothes. I also loathe laundry and would love to do less of it. At this point it feels like the clothes have taken over my life.


But, it feels weird to get rid of newish clothes that I still like. Is there a particular strategy to follow?

minimalism,Minimalism and Anxiety,"While I see many benefits to working towards minimalism, it has definitely cause me to put a lot of pressure on myself to pare down to only the essentials. In my anxiety riddled brain, not even those things that hold strong emotional value are safe from trying to donate or throw stuff out. I wanted to share one of those experiences so that people get a better understanding of what minimalism is and what it isn't.

A couple of weeks ago, I was cleaning up my room and trying to rearrange my storage space to accommodate my winter clothes. In one of my boxes were four figures that were essentially decorations to allow my nerd flag to fly. As someone who has somewhat transitioned out of my nerd years (I say somewhat because I don't think I'll 100% be a not-nerd), I thought I would try and get rid of these things. They weren't even being used as decorations, just taking up space in a box that could be put to better use.

But I just couldn't convince myself to part with them. And once I realized that, I was wondering what might be wrong with me. I've been working on my commitment to only have what I need, and to me, these decorations are not what I need. Why was it so difficult to get rid of them?

So I sent a video to my closest friends telling them my predicament, thinking through most of that video that I was detached enough from them that I should be able to get rid of them. But when I had pointed this out to my friends, I ended up crying as I finished up my video. I was frustrated with myself, thinking that I was more attached to the items than I was to my commitment to become more minimalistic.

The message I got back from my friends was that it was clear that they still held emotional value to me, and since that was the case, I should hold onto them for just a bit longer until I felt like I could part with them without it causing me distress. This message made me contemplate what it was about these items that held so much emotional value. And I realized that it was what they represented rather than what they are that held all that value for me. They represented something that motivated me to return to hobbies I had previously given up on. And since they were all character figures, they also represented qualities that I love about myself, basically the beginnings of me developing my self-esteem. This is a huge amount of emotional value and, as such, I felt more at peace with the fact that I'd be holding onto them for at least another year.

So, to all of you who have stuck with this post so far, I want to point out to you what minimalism is. Minimalism is a way to help you free yourself from how items can hold you back. It's a way to remind yourself what matters most, and let those things that are not your priority make way for what is. Minimalism is meant to be a freeing experience that builds you up and broadens your perspective.

Minimalism is **not** asceticism. It's not trying to push you to live a life of poverty or to have a house that is empty of anything that is a reflection of your identity. It is not meant to take things from you that are priceless emotionally. It is not meant to make you feel like you're lesser for not getting rid of something that someone else would have no problem giving up.

Your idea of minimalism is going to differ from someone else's idea of minimalism, and that's okay. If you live with anxiety, sometimes even your idea of minimalism is not what you need at that moment in your life. Do not let your commitment to a lifestyle cause you distress. Do not let your mind tell you that you are living a lie if you are not adhering to your idea of minimalism in that moment.

Minimalism is about finding the value in the small things, in finding value in yourself, and depending on where you are in your personal journey, minimalism will mean keeping a few trinkets that mean the world to you. And that's okay. What you hold onto today you may end up being able to give up tomorrow, without hurting yourself. Just take everything one step at a time, one day at a time, and you will be able to make the progress you most need.",2019-07-30 18:20:50,6,71
minimalism,How can my kitchen be minimalist?,"Hello guys, I'm new to this sub. Here's my story to begin with. Me and my wife decided we should simplify our lives and get rid of excessive stuff and clothes we have, so we can keep our house constantly tidy and clean more easily.

But I just don't know how can we make our kitchen a better place too. We've already adopted a one glass per person rule, so we have two different colored tall glasses, one for each of us. What else could we do to reduce kitchen clutter, food waste and, hopefully optimize cooking and dishwashing?

minimalism,Am I a minimalist?,"

I would consider myself a minimalist;however, there are still some material things I do very much enjoy. The reason I consider myself a minimalist is because I don’t really want a big house, I take pictures of gifts/sentimental items for memories but I don’t keep them, and finally I buy clothes every 3 years and have a simple yet nice wardrobe. 

Here is where I have my doubts though. I really enjoy technology as a whole. I would love an 8k 70 inch flat screen with a 2000 dollar surround sound system. I would love to own a Tesla one day once it becomes more mainstream. I love building computers and having a “cozy” home. Not cluttered in the slightest, just lots of lamp lighting and comfortable furniture. 

Obviously these things are pricey, but I already own a sizable two story farmhouse with property, so I feel like it wouldn’t be that much. I honestly never spend money on anything and most of it is invested in stocks. If these things bring me joy, am I still a minimalist? It wouldn’t be one of those things where in two weeks you are just used to it, but these things bring me long term happiness. What are your guy’s thoughts?",2019-07-30 15:12:40,10,3

minimalism,Am I being minimalist or just being cheap?,"Hey all,   


I have been living a minimalist and frugal lifestyle for sometime now. Recently I have been questioning if my choices are driven more by my minimalism or if I am just being a frugal cheapskate.   


*A few examples:* I have a backpack that I got from a work vendor 5 years ago. It's a high quality backpack but is brightly colored with gaudy brand logos all over it. I hate the way it looks but I refuse to replace it because I think it would be a waste to not use it. I use it to commute to work and the office is fairly professional. I have had jokes cracked about it multiple times from coworkers and it makes me feel that it is unprofessional.    


I play a sport multiple times a week that requires a lot of protective equipment. I have been wearing stuff for a number of years that is not necessarily built for the frequency I use it. Some of the equipment I literally have to tie together with old laces to just to keep using them. Multiple times I get in situations where I will feign from action because I know I will break said equipment. Teammates have cracked jokes and will often give me their old equipment.     


I have holes in some of my socks, shoes and shirts that I justify that there is still some use out of them. I mainly wear them when doing a dirty task or if I know I am not going out/seeing people. I have 2-3 versions of each. I keep telling myself i'd rather use it one more time before it does to a landfill but is it justifiable to have that many versions of it? 

&#x200B;

I love to cook and have been making homemade pasta recently. I don't have a mixer or anything so it's a long process. Even though I cook pasta at least 2 times a week, I still do not have a pasta strainer. I try to use a lid to pour a majority of the water out before I ""strain"" them with a spoon into a bowl.  Since I already spend a lot of time mixing and cutting I justify it as it's only a couple more minutes to do it this way.   


Personally minimalism to me is about not wasting anything, but I am realizing it may be hindering me when I am being cheap. I have recently started to buy better quality newer items but have trouble making the leap to buying what I know I want and need.   


What do you think? Am I just being cheap? What do you do to get over the waste aspect? Any rules of thumb I should try to follow? Thanks!",2019-07-30 10:53:55,21,25

minimalism,Minimalism has made me a better musician - what has it made you better at?,"I think we all understand the benefits of a clutter-free home, the financial benefits of spending less, the environmental benefits of generating less waste, etc. But what has the concept of minimalism helped you improve upon when applied to your job, skills, hobbies, or relationships?  


\_\_\_

Example:  
I'm a musician and I do everything from teaching private lessons to recording session work and live performance. Minimalism has made a huge impact on the way that I conceive of music and the way I relate to the instruments themselves.  


To me, the core idea of minimalism is to get rid of the things you don't need to focus on the things that you do. When I apply this idea to songwriting, I cut out all of the filler and try to get right down to the simple heart/message of the song. By extension, this applies to production because I can focus my energy on making a few key instruments sound full and lively instead of crowding a mix with tons of layers of over-complicated, unnecessary filler.   


Even my instruments are stripped down, forcing me to step up with my playing and my performance instead of relying on effects or getting caught up in the gear. I've noticed that the tone of my instruments is better with less effects and stuff in the way. I can develop a stronger relationship with the few instruments/effects I do use and learn how to use them more creatively.   


Minimalism has also changed how I take gigs. I'm a multi-instrumentalist sideman with years of experience, so I get asked to play with a lot of different bands around town. If I said yes to everyone, I would have no life left and the music would start to suffer (there was a point where I was working for like 6 bands at once) because I wouldn't be able to give any one project the time and attention it needs. Since simplifying my life, I've learned to focus on the projects that matter most to me. I still love working with new artists, but I've learned to say no when I need to so I'm not compromising. Minimalism taught me that by showing me the importance of keeping things simple and removing unnecessary burdens/clutter from life.

minimalism,Minimalist Backpack,"""Minimalism as a lifestyle can be extended to trips, and how you prepare for them. Thus our backpack can follow such guidelines. Be your trip short or long, what you carry with you is of the utmost importance.  On this video I'll show how to prepare you backpack to carry only the essentials, which brings the benefit of freedom when you're travelling. 

As mentioned, the key point is to always questions yourself ""is this essential?"". If not, then it should not come along. 

For my 28 days backpacking trip to Europe I only took with me three outfits (counting the one I was wearing). If you're doing the same, this means that you should take special attention when choosing said outfits. Their fabric should be good, with a special consideration to the time needed to dry. Also, basic looks are nice, since they allow you the possibility to be relatively well dressed in every situation.  

It's not because you're travelling that you can't look reasonably presentable.  

The other things will depend on your needs, and where you're travelling. If you're not going to stay in a hotel, a towel is a must have. I took with me a face one, since it's smaller. Gadgets that you enjoy are also an important thing to carry.  

To be able to travel with such a limited amount of things is something nice, and I myself am proud of being able to do it. This, plus the fact that it was genuinely fun. ""

minimalism,"My choice to slowly transition into Minimalism is... not satisfying! Encouragement, please","I recently made the decision to move towards minimalism for the same reasons that most people seem to: removing physical and mental clutter, not participating in the fast-fashion type culture, having a less-bad impact on the environment and on workers around the world, saving money for things and experiences that are truly worth it, etc.

After reading this article on how [the concept of thoughtful consumption does not start with a purge](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-life-changing-magic-of-making-do/) I decided to make this a slow and deliberate move into real minimalism.  We have been donating or getting rid of items that are true clutter (shirts that I never wear, those gifted chalices with the butterflies that... just no) but the rest, I have decided to keep using until it has finished serving its purpose.  This prevents me both filling up the landfill with serviceable items and prevents me from wearing through my remaining items more quickly, as the use is spread among more things.  Those items will only be replaced if needed, and in those cases with ethical, long lasting alternatives.  I am happy with this decision.  It seems the most ethical, reasonable way to go for my set of beliefs.

But... it's so dissatisfying.  Maybe it's because I'm used to capitalistic instant gratification, but I want to do the purge.  I want to feel like my decision to move into minimalism has been made real.  Right now, it just feels theoretical and I don't feel like I'm getting the full clear-life/clear-mind benefits that a big purge would offer.  It's just not a thing that I can personally justify.

I know most of you here have chosen to do the purge.  Not only do I understand that decision, I am envious of it.  But, I am wondering if anyone else has chosen this slow route and if so, can you tell me how it went for you?  I just need some encouragement.  Thank you!",2019-07-30 05:03:20,28,24

I keep almost zero photos in my phone, and the ones I do have require an action. Do I want to upload a photo to instagram (because yes, I still have instagram and yes, it brings me joy)? Once it's uploaded, I delete it. 

It actually helps with a lot of things. If I need to take a screenshot of information I need to save, a receipt, a book I want to research, a quote I want to look up, etc. It's nice because it feels functional and enhances my life. Plus who needs 2,000 pictures of a vacation where most of them are blurry and that you'll never look at again? For the photos I actually want to save, I back them up or put them on a hard drive so I don't lose all those memories if my phone falls into the ocean (again).

I moved to a new appartment with nothing but a few clothes and small stuff and I mean to keep it minimal. I do have a matress but I'd like to get by without a frame. But my question is: What is good matress care? My concerns are possible mold and/or morphing of the matress from standing it up for airing. I have a new memory foam 2-level matress and I stand it up for airing every morning. I guess I should switch the sides every day when I put it up to keep it from morphing in one direction?

minimalism,"My weird, minimalist vacation.","This is a bit of a rambly post. 

I'm on a kinda weird vacation in England. Me and my friend got to London on Tuesday, and were supposed to leave Thursday (yesterday) evening. We were one of the people who were unfortunate enough to be on one of the flights that were cancelled due to bad weather. We spent a hellish night with no sleep at the airport, and now (Friday) we're finally at a nice hotel for two nights, until our new flight on Sunday.

So our vacation just got doubled.

I packed the following in a regular sized backpack and a small shoulder bag for a trip that was supposed to be 3 days:

- 3 pairs of socks
- 5 pairs of undies
- 1 shirt
- 1 dress
- denim jacket 
- my watch
- wallet, keys, passport, phone
- headphones and phone charger
- 5 protein bars (2 left now) 
- sunnies 
- makeup and toiletries
- water bottle
- small map of London 

I was wearing denim shorts and a t-shirt. We gave a load of laundry to the hotel, because we obviously didn't pack for 5 days. I'm happy with what I brought. So far I've used everything. 

I recently put myself on a no-buy for the rest of the year, with the following rules:

NO BUY 2019

exceptions:

- groceries
- fixing things
- sewing things, but use up fabric first / do thrift flips
- gifts (preferably no gifts, useful gifts only)
- necessity 

The only material things I got since we got here are:

- Suede cork platform sandals, because I don't have comfortable sandals, they're beautiful and they were 60% off. Only £22,50! I'm going to sell the sandals that I have, because they give me blisters. 

- A Marks&Spencers vintage coat. This needs to be altered, so I know I'll have a good couple hours of fun with this coat and my sewing machine! I still needed a light coat for fall and spring, because the one I have now is a heavy cotton and is more appropriate for the edge of winter. 

- A water bottle, because my friend was buying one and it was buy one get one free. It has dinosaurs on it. 

My friend wanted to go into charity shops, to look for some fun items to add to her wardrobe, and of course I went with her. I even tried some things on, things that looked good on me! I realised then:

Not everything that looks good on you, needs to be yours. 

Yeah, the clothes were cheap and cute, but I didn't need them. And looking cute in the mirror for two minutes was enough for me. Minimalism is a part of every aspect of my life. It's not just about material things. It's practicing mindfulness, being intentional and focused. I'm so happy I've found something that works for me.",2019-07-26 12:19:15,34,214

minimalism,Project New Brain: Seeking research participants,"\*This post was pre-approved by mods 

\*Would like to thank the moderators for allowing this post.

# Project New Brain  

**What is Project New Brain?** 

A free neuroscience project aimed at helping you form permanent health-related brain patterns(habit) that last. We accept participants on **weekly social contracts** at **no cost** while providing personal checkups, rewards, and donations based on their performance. This is a **research in** **progress** and we need your help to perfect it. 

&#x200B;

**Why call it a brain pattern and not a habit?** 

A habit is a combination of many patterns formed in the brain. Multiple synapses must form solidly for habits to last. Thus, we go beyond a “Just do it” approach 

&#x200B;

**How is this different from other habit-forming methodologies?** 

We bring expertise from neuroscience and behavioural psychology to develop the most efficient and effective protocols for neurological pattern forming. We use the following formulas(hypothesis): 

1. Good cause: we make donations every time you reach a certain level of pattern forming. 
2. Social Contract(free): You engage in a social contract of sharing your commitment. 
3. Visualization: write it down and see your progress and results. 
4. Personal checkups (through emails, messages): we check your progress for accountability. 
5. Reward points(neurons): healthy dopamine rush that leads to our donations.   
 

**We start the next trial round on July 29th and now accepting limited participants.** Every round, we’ll increase the participant count. 

**For more information** about the process, reward, and this research as a whole, please visit our subreddit and check \[Meta\] and \[Accepting\] tagged post.   
  

You’re welcomed to message us anytime.

minimalism,I don't feel any better,"My journey started about a month ago, when I sold all my consoles.

Around this time, I got introduced to the idea of minimalism in fashion, and the benefits of having a uniform. That's when I decided to give away all my clothes and ordered a brand new wardrobe. Today, the last pieces have arrived and my uniform is finally complete. I can say I'm finally ""done"", there's nothing else I feel like I can do away with.

minimalism,How to leave the phone out of sight to help focus,"
I silence my phone and barely touch it when I am working or studying. Yet it is within my periphery out of my fear that 
my family needs me urgently. The issue I find here is that I feel as if part of my brain is still *distracted* as long as 
the phone is there. I think I am still fighting the urge to pick up the phone and surf the web / check email / msgs and 
stuff (I barely have any apps though).

Here are some ideas that I couldn't swallow:

1. Smart watch. It should allow me to still check for urgent calls with very limited functionalities, but I am afraid 
this it would make things even worse and distract me even further since it's attached on my limb.

2. Flip phone. Sadly I must rely on it for photos, videos, emails, calling Uber etc..

3. Minimalist smartphone. Nope, I am not spending $300.

4. Smaller / older phone. My phone is already as bare as it gets!

not to get distracted, but if this was possible I wouldn't have to practise minimalism...",2019-07-25 06:50:44,24,10

Currently I'm super minimalist about my clothes - black t-shirts and black leggings in mild weather or dark colored turtle necks and black leggings in cold weather - but to be honest, this is partly because of minimalism and partly because I feel more confident in my body in these styles and don't have the confidence to dress more boldly.

I like the idea of using the weight loss to create an entirely well-thought-out wardrobe, that is minimalist but also sparks joy.

minimalism,"After a minimal year, moving into a house of our own","Long story short my wife and I miscalculated moving to a new city and spent the last year floating from room to room. We’ve become severely minimalist—not according to any philosophy or aesthetic, but for purely functional and I daresay emotional reasons: it was just easier to be able to pack everything we own in the car and go. We’ve found... it’s actually really nice! Not without its disadvantages, but on the balance very liberating.

My wife just got a new job in a neighboring town that includes a house as part of the compensation package. It’s not large at all and it’s humble and funky and snug...

... and I’ve been on cloud 9 for 24 hours. We’ll have our own kitchen and bathroom(s!) and... *gasp* our own washers and dryer. Room to garden and room for a little woodshop...

... and it’s like five times bigger than any space we’ve had for a while now and it’s just hitting me that it’s going to be oh-so-easy to fall into old habits. It’s only been a year and only in the last six months or so that we really started to appreciate minimalism for reasons other than necessity. 

Driving home today we talked about how to adjust. Our bedroom will just be the bed room. We’ll only move in what we need, and get rid of the rest of what we’ve got stored. Let’s make sure we never accumulate more than what fits in one tiny Uhaul... That sorta thing...

minimalism,Thoughts on minimalism and environmentalism in regards to gifts?,"I’ve seen many posts on this sub expressing frustration with others (usually parents or people from the previous generation) that consider gift giving as an integral expression of love. When told by the giftee that they don’t want physical gifts (except maybe consumables) then this is often met with disdain, misunderstanding, and potentially viewed as ungrateful. A common piece of advice I’ve seen given is that the parents hold different values and express their love differently, and our values as minimalists are no more valid or invalid than their values.

On one hand I can see the wisdom in this advice, but overall I disagree from an environmental and cultural standpoint. Excessive consumerism and overproduction of products is negatively impacting this planet. It is negatively impacting the areas where those goods are manufactured. It is negatively impacting our culture as consumers because people think things = happiness/love/success. Do we not have a moral obligation to humanity as a whole to *respectfully* fight against these behaviors? I think seeing materialistic values and minimalistic values as being equal only further legitimizes the destruction that is happening on this planet. If someone’s personal values included burning down my home then I would not idly sit by and say that they are equally as valid in their viewpoint as I am in mine.

minimalism,Decluttering my phone lowered my anxiety levels,"I took a few steps since I do a lot of work on my phone it can be overwhelming at times. The way that it’s set up stock, I think is designed to fuel cyber addiction. First thing I did was to turn off all unnecessary notifications, and disable all of the badge notifications like the ones that tell you how many emails you have unread on the home page. I went further with disabling the notifications by leaving do not disturb mode on most of the time, and only allowing phone calls through. I leave my phone on vibrate most of the time unless I’m distracted, most phone calls aren’t actual people anymore and if it is they’ll usually leave a message. I also took advantage of organizing my lesser used apps into folders, and only the highly used ones remain out on the home screen. I’ve got my phone down to two pages of apps, with the second being only one row and I find myself feeling the need to look at my phone a whole lot less. It’s made me more productive, and my anxiety has gone way down. Definitely recommend giving it a try.

minimalism,"I want to purge my belongings again, but I don't see anything TO purge, but I also feel cluttered...where do I begin again?","I'm surrounded by mess, I feel the mess, and I want to declutter again since I try to each season. But I don't see what to toss. I was wondering if there were tips or easier ways you all start the process when you've been nesting and hoarding for a while... My hobbies change easily and frequently, so I buy things needed for the hobby then sell them when I'm done/lose interest/determine I'm not a good fit. Currently this includes my letter writing supplies, camera supplies, etc. But there are other hobbies that I'm not ready to part with even though they take up a lot of clutter. Marker collections, unused journals, books upon books of how-to-draw and how-to-write, dice for dungeons and dragons (the hoard is the part that sparks joy!) and books I want to read but am scared to...

&#x200B;

It doesn't help that each time I purge my donations pile never goes anywhere. I live at home so my parents refuse to let me toss it, but won't take me out to donate it, and won't take it off my hands (because i snap back with ""IF you're the one who wants me to keep it, why don't you take it and keep it?).

minimalism,Those damn souvenir shirts,"Pretty sure a lot of you people had to deal with this in the past. My parents happen to travel a lot and although I told them not to buy me anything, they do it nevertheless. It has gotten a lot better, but they still get my stuff every now and then, especially shirts. Mostly shirts I will never ever wear, unless I force myself and then I don't feel good wearing them. 
So - how do y'all handle situations like that? Telling my parents to stop buying trash obviously doesn't help. So do I wear the shirts although I hate them? Do I donate them right away? Or do I put them in my drawer, let them sit for a couple of years, and donate them afterwards (which is my current solution tbh)?",2019-07-24 05:59:15,30,17

minimalism,"Accumulation, addiction to a certain luxury, and the prospect of van-life to pursue my passion.","I’m curious how y’all deal with accumulation over time.  I parsed my items down to only what I used about one-to-two years ago.  I was super happy with my minimization.  Since then, I’ve ended up acquiring a lot of stuff.  New camera, new computer, new camping gear, more climbing gear, etc.  

I track everything I purchase and have checked on what I’ve bought vs. what I still use.  I still use nearly everything I still have.  Almost all of my purchases I, I use on a regular basis or, I’ll need them for the future (seasonal gear).  

I no longer feel happy with myself as a “minimalist” but, it’s also allowed me to live the life I want to live for the past two years and it’s been lovely.

So, I think the question I’m asking is more:  how do you deal with the FEELING of accumulation?  Am I comparing myself to others?  Does my ego need to die?  (I’m thinking this is the correct answer)

——————————————————————————

My elaborate computer setup is a luxury.  I use every part of it, everyday.  But, it still feels like a ball and chain, also, excessive.  I hate using any other computer because it’s just not as satisfactory of an experience.  It’s also the only aspect of my life which I can’t bring with me on-the-go.  Troubling considering I don’t really have any issues moving otherwise.  I basically have my clothes, my cooking ware/coffee/tea stuff, a ton of climbing gear/camping gear, my bikes (road/mountain), camera gear, computer gear, and a decent amount of tools.

The reason I bring it up:  Ideally I’m going to be living 3 days a week out of a van (Friday-Sunday) in the next year.  I could easily live my life with everything I need packed into a van.  I’d have to parse down a bit but, not by much.  The ONLY thing I would feel I’m missing out on (besides a bathroom) is my computer.  The fucking ball and chain in my life.  I love it too much to get rid of it.  Quite frankly, it’s mostly my speakers and headphones.  But, it’s also the fact that my computer is fast and doesn’t get bogged down opening google chrome like my work computer does.  Which makes me want to put a bullet in my head.  It’s a luxury I’ve had the pleasure of having access to but, now, it feels restrictive.

Do I accept the fact that I am snooty and keep it in my life?  Do I eliminate the temptation?  

I could build it into my van but, that would take space.  It’d also cost money.  But, I’d enjoy the hell out of it.

Or, I could move on, drop my ball and chain, and live without inhibition.  

Any thoughts?  It’s something I’ve been struggling with for almost two years.",2019-07-24 00:45:43,2,2
minimalism,Do careers make minimalism difficult?,"I recently decided to go back to Uni for computer programming, something that’s been on my mind is how difficult would it be for a programmer to be a minimalist? It seems that many people enjoy collecting useless stuff, and especially in an industry revolving around technology I wonder how difficult would it be for me to practice minimalism? 

I already consider myself a simple man, I don’t spend a lot of money on food, video games, going to the movies, etc. I have a lot of computers since I used to build them. I’m not a fan of consumerism, money and materialist items don’t motivate me. Having a good career, a good education, a future wife and kids, that’s a goal I’d enjoy more than saving to by the next pair of $200 shoes. 

I enjoy reading, playing video games occasionally, spending time outdoors with friends and going to the gym.  Sometimes I also wonder If being a minimalist is difficult on relationships or unattractive to women who look for men with nice cars and fancy clothes but that’s not me.

I recently moved into a 1000sqft 1940s home with my husband. I’m a “have only what you need” kind of minimalist (so our house looks pretty normal - just really really clean). My husband is pretty on board with it, and I don’t pressure him to declutter his 70 t-shirts and 8 pairs of sweats.

At some point, he must have mentioned to his mom that I declutter a lot (non-useful items make their way out the door pretty quickly when I’m around).

So now every time I see my MIL, she says something like, “well I would have gotten you a shirt when I went to _____ but juxtaposehere would have just thrown it away!”

Bitch our closets are the width of a door and my husband has TWO of them filled with shirts. We don’t need yet another crappy tourist shirt he’ll never wear crammed in there. Thank you and good day

but recently i've seen too much discourse about individual change and not much about what systemic issues are causing this trends.

oh you want to live in a clean and relaxing space, that's because advertising and capital is basing inside you head making it hard to cope with life.

oh, you want to live in a tiny little wood house. that's because of landlords exploiting property values and forcing people to either live in tiny spaces or living in a space with people you don't want to live with.

living in a van, is just homelessness. there is nothing beautiful about that.

wake up guys, we need to be more self aware, understand the real problems you are trying to solve, and we should stop putting the burden of solving this on the individual. If we don't, capital will recuperate our movement and will sell it to us for a higher price. which is ALREADY HAPPENING.

I do realize i've painted the image of van dwelling as homelessness, as if it was not a choice. guys, it is a choice for many of us. but it isn't a choice for the majority. so it is homelessness caused by poverty.

2- I am not saying you guys are victims, if we have time to argue on the internet we are privileged as fuck, we are not the victims, but look, there is systemic issues at play that makes real victims and minimalism is ignoring this problems while most of us, minimalists, do it because of our generational poverty. be it as a way to cope, to scape, or to survive

In my opinion, the goal of contentment is a much better concept. The definition includes happiness, but also includes satisfaction.

I picture contentment as a ""that will do"" kind of thought. You're grateful for what you have, the people around you, and the events you've experienced. It doesn't mean you're jumping for joy every second of every day, but the gratitude and satisfaction makes you realize that life is good.

For study on attachment to material possessions: personality and motivational factors.

*this posting has been Mod approved * 

Hi everyone, My name is Jolene and I am a 4th year Psychology Honours student at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. My supervisor - Dr. James Collett and I are looking for volunteers to participate in an anonymous online survey to help us determine the personality and motivational traits associated with attachment to material possessions in the general population, as this may indicate a vulnerability to hoarding behaviours. Even if you do not experience difficulties with this we invite you to participate. 

Our overall aim is to determine a trait profile associated with attachment to material possessions which could assist with the early recognition and treatment of individuals experiencing difficulties with hoarding behaviours. 

Anyone who is 18+ years can participate, and you don’t have to experience any difficulties with this.
The online survey takes around 30 minutes to complete and is completely voluntary and anonymous. 

To find out more information, and to participate in the study, please follow the link below:

minimalism,[Lifestyle] I feel like I'm not living the simple life I want.,"So, this whole thing is probably going to come across as a rant as I get these issues off my chest. 

I've been aware of minimalism since 2014 when I found The Minimalists' (Josh and Ryan) blog. Since then I've had this idea of living in a small home with just the essentials and being able to use my free time to pursue the things I want. 

I fell into the beginners mistake of getting rid of everything, because having few possessions would magically solve all my problems. I've tried to cut down on all of my physical possessions, but I still find myself with my laptop, tablet, smartphone, gaming console, e-reader, and hundreds of books, movies, CD's, vinyl records, and I still can't get past internet usage. For awhile I prided myself on having no social media except Reddit and dreamt of living an internet free life, but I still use Reddit, play video games online, I still watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. I still watch hours of YouTube videos every day. 

I feel like I'm still buying things like books, movies, music, and games and my home is still full of \*stuff\*. Am I doing this wrong? Am I failing? It feels overwhelming and I don't think I'll ever escape my consumerist life, even though I want to just live this cozy, simple life. Some days when it really bogs me down, I daydream of just walking off into nature like Chris McCandless, but I know that's absurd. 

Anyway. If you read this far, thank you.",2019-07-22 11:26:29,6,12
minimalism,Minimalist Basics and Style.,"So I've been into minimalism for a while now. I think where many people get hung up on is clothing, and I just wanted to offer my personal clothing selection, and possibly even get feedback.  I originally started dressing minimally out of convenience and because it simplified my life.  To me what minimal style is, is higher end basics that I only have to buy once, and it will last me practically forever. For me personally I really only own things in monochromatic colors.  So basically all of my clothes are black, gray, and white.  I also avoid logos, and tend to again go for higher end basics that way they actually last.  Brands that I feel are a great investment, that meet the minimal high end aesthetic are:

1. Uniqlo- Uniqlo has a number of amazing basics, that are higher end quality and basically affordable.  Most of my clothes are from here.  I highly recommend their t shirts, hoodies, selvage denim, etc.
2. Everlane- Everlane makes higher end basics.  Kinda pricy but they make good stuff and it's also a sustainable brand.
3. Common Projects- Basically the greatest of all time minimal sneaker. Everyone loves them, and they're super high quality, but of course ver expensive.  There are great alternatives though.  For me personally I own beckett simonon sneakers. I have the GAT and the minimal sneaker.  Both are great.  Koio is another great alternative that I own. Another brand that's getting a lot of internet “attention” lately is Oliver Cabell.
4. Wings and Horns- Wings and Horns specializes in textiles that again are higher quality.  Most of their clothing is monochromatic which I love. Their sneakers are also great.  Everything gives off that minimal vibe.
5. Reigning Champ- Sister company to Wings and Horns.  They again specialize in higher end textiles and fabrics but for athleisure type clothing.  They also make some cool collaboration stuff with Adidas, New Balance, and others.
6. Comme De Garcons- Not really my thing, but a lot of people swear by the clothing that it's high quality. Again basics that are higher end. What tends to separate them from everyone else, is the heart logo with the eyes. I'm sure everyone's seen this by now, especially on the newer chuck taylors and whatnot.
7. A Days March- A newer brand with high quality stuff.  I don't own anything from them, but I hear good things.  Most people love their button downs and their over shirts.
8. APC- APC is a higher end european company that focuses on minimal clothing and higher end denim.  No labels or branding and high quality materials.  However typically very expensive, but you can find some decent sales sometimes.
9. Acne- Much like APC they focus on minimal clothing and higher end basics.  They have nice sneakers and outerwear as well, but again kinda expensive. 
10. Pact- Pact apparel is gaining some speed lately.  Like everlane they make higher end basics but with sustainability in mind.  

So those are just some brands that come to mind off the top of my head.  Does anyone else have any recommendations? Thanks!",2019-07-22 10:48:35,21,48

minimalism,I sold all my belongings! My minimalism journey and what's next...,"About three years ago I discovered minimalism (currently 21). As someone interested in living a simple life, while being environmentally friendly and financially free, minimalism really appealed to me. Slowly but surely I started to reduce the amount of items I had and really narrow down on what is important to me. A week ago, I took the biggest step yet and decided to sell the remaining items of everything I owned. I'm moving to California in August for a year long internship and they provide furnished living quarters. I thought about storing my items because they are the things I thought added value to my life because they were what remained after three years of minimizing. After talking to friends and posting on this subreddit, I made the decision to just sell it all!

You can read original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/cbj3tn/im\_moving\_should\_i\_put\_my\_items\_in\_storage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/cbj3tn/im_moving_should_i_put_my_items_in_storage/)

&#x200B;

I started with sell, donate and keep piles. And the more I sold and added to the donation pile the easier it became to pair down the keep pile even more! Now I am on the other side with everything gone except what I really value and I have never felt more free!! I kept a simple wardrobe, a few books, my yoga mat and a couple of other functional items I use regularly. Even better, I used the money I made to contribute a couple of large payments into two investment accounts I started as well as towards student loans.  I will now continue to contribute to my retirement, safety net account and student loans monthly. I should be debt free by 25 and on my way to financial freedom!

minimalism,Debating a flip phone...,"Hey all! I was wondering on y’alls thoughts on getting a flip/slide phone. 

Over the past few years I have gradually reduced the amount of social media that I use (with the only social media I use being Reddit and YouTube). That being said, I only use those apps when I am home and have down time. Because of the reducing of social media in my life, I hardly ever use my iPhone and really only use it for texting my boyfriend, the occasional GPS, the occasional YouTube video or Reddit scroll, and checking my email/work schedule (which could be done on my laptop). 

So...this got me thinking. Should I just cancel my phone bill and get a flip or slide (which I would be able to text a little easier with—necessary because I have a long distance relationship with my boyfriend during the college semester) phone? Over the past 2 and a half years the most data I have used in a single month is 0.17g (I mostly use what i do use, JUST because I am paying for it) and I am currently paying a few dollars short of $60 (yes, I know that is absolutely insane) for I believe unlimited talk and text (which I don’t need either) and somewhere between 3g-10g of data (I am not sure exactly how much data I am buying due to the fact my account is under my father’s name, but I do know that it is NOT unlimited).  I am absolutely mind blown at how expensive it is... I even called AT&T and they said they don’t have any smaller plans. They said they used to have what they called a “Grandfather Plan” but have recently gotten rid of it, and I, being a 19 y/o girl am shocked that so few people use this little data! 

Should I invest in a flip/slide phone for calls and texts in which I could buy the exact amount of call/text that I need, and then keep my phone for when I have WiFi (at my parents house, at work, and at college), use an old GPS for when I need to get directions in my car, and use my school laptop for everything else? I like that idea in many regards, but having so many devices to me just isn’t minimal when I could have one fully functional smartphone that can do everything I need (minus being something I could type my college work on) in one? 

I personally am really struggling here with finding something that would work...I mean a flip phone WOULD be cheaper. Is there another phone company that has plans that would better suite me and my bank account? I know there is a phone company called Republic that allows you to just pay for 1g of data (or exactly what you use), however, I haven’t heard great things about their service, plus they don’t do Apple phones, which means if i went with them I’d have to buy a different type of smart phone, which seems absolutely ridiculous in that I don’t need to buy something that I already have just to get a better deal on my phone bill. 

Just wanted to know if anyone had ideas on how to get a more minimal phone and hopefully phone bill based on my needs! Thanks guys! 

I will say though, either way, I’m definitely NOT sticking with AT&T—that’s for sure!",2019-07-20 19:30:53,13,0

minimalism,Letting go of sentimental items that were weighing me down,"I have been decluttering & donating entire carloads of stuff to Goodwill every 3-4 months for the past 5 years. I've drastically cut down on mindless shopping and bringing new things into the home (though I'm not perfect). In additional to the physical stuff, I've also KonMari'ed my work responsibilities, finances, email inbox, calendar/schedule, social media, and relationships. Slowly but surely, my life has become so much simpler and happier. Everything in my home & apartment sparks joy. I'm grateful to past me for all the time she's put in over the years to get to this point.

I just moved to a tiny apartment, so I did another round of KonMari'ing. I can't believe there's still stuff to declutter even after 5 years. Today I am taking the latest round of stuff to Goodwill. There's only a few boxes this time, but I'm really proud to finally let go of things that have been weighing me down mentally for years:

- Gorgeous boots that I never wore in the 3 years I've owned them because the heels kill my feet. I couldn't let go of these earlier because they were expensive, but I'm sick of opening my now very curated closet and feeling guilty every morning when I see them. Out they go.

- A yoga mat/bricks I've owned for 10 years and have used once. I'd always thought I'd wanted to get into yoga, but I've done a few yoga sessions over the past year and discovered it wasn't for me. I'd held on to these items just in case I change my mind, but I'm sick of feeling guilty for not using them every time I see them. Out.

- Some board games I used to play with friends in college that we haven't played in 10+ years. The game boxes are heavy and take up a lot of space. I realize I kept them because they bring back happy memories, but I don't need the physical reminder. Luckily I'm still in close contact with all of those college friends and see them regularly. Board games aren't our thing anymore anyway. They all have little ones so now we play more kid friendly games! But I'm hoping someone will find this in Goodwill and create lots of fun new memories with their friends.

- A small stack of unread books that loved ones had given me as presents over the years but weren't interesting to me. I'm a voracious reader (50-80 books/year), and when I'm excited about a book, I tear through it in a few days. The fact that I hadn't read those in 5 years means it's time to go. No point in forcing myself to read these out of guilt when there are too many good books out there waiting for me to read them!

- Two giant combs I used to need when I was in my 20's and had gorgeous thick curly hair. A decade later, my hair is thinner so I condition/detangle with my fingers to avoid yanking out hair with the comb. I've had one of those combs since high school. But it makes me sad to see them; they remind me of my old head of hair that I miss. Time to go.

- A nearly unused set of Moleskin colored pencils I bought while traveling. I thought I'd get into drawing, sketching, or coloring for stress relief and creativity. I tried it a few times and it's not my thing; I prefer plain journaling with a notebook & pen. I used to LOVE colored pencils as a kid and had hoped that this new set would bring me back to those moments,  so I kept them around in case I felt the urge hit me. It hasn't. Out they go.

- A couple gorgeous crystal vases I got from my dad. He sends me beautiful birthday flowers in nice vases every year, so I have accumulated a small collection. I kept the one vase I love the most and am donating the rest. I feel guilty for doing this since they're from my dad, but I also don't need 5 vases. I also told him how much I love the annual flower tradition but asked him not to buy more vases since I already have one from him that I love.

- A pink dress from Anthropologie that I LOVE but don't fit into anymore. I was hanging on to it just in case I dropped two dress sizes, but I realized how much it bummed me out to open my closet and never being able to wear it. Not good for my self esteem. I love my body and I have enough dresses that make me feel beautiful that actually fit me. Time to go.

- Two pairs of flats that were my first designer shoes from 5 years ago. They're a bit worn now and the colors don't match with my new capsule wardrobe. I held on to them out of nostalgia and because they were pricy. I wore them a few times recently to see if I could still use them, but they tore up my poor feet. Thank u next.

- An Ikea serving platter I'd used to entertain for the past 10 years. Problem was I never really liked it, I just got it because it was cheap and useful. I was unpacking it the other day and had a sense of disappointment when I held it. I'm grateful that it got me through all my dinner parties, but it's time for an upgrade.

I thanked all these items for the happy memories, took photos of them, and lovingly packed them into the donation boxes. I had been hanging onto these things for years because of the loved ones who gave them to me (books, vases), the ideals I had for my future self (a yogi, a wearer of high heeled boots), or the memories of my past self (coloring, combs, dress, games). It occurs to me that this was one of the most difficult decluttering sessions I've ever done. I thought I'd feel dread when I saw these sentimental items packed up in boxes, but conversely, it felt SO freeing. Like I was letting go of all of the guilt and expectations I'd been carrying for years. I can't describe the feeling; I just feel so light and happy, like my future is wide open. I'm still grateful for the happy memories of the past, but I don't need the physical reminders anymore. I don't think would have been able to finally let go of these things if it hadn't been for the 5 years of decluttering practice before this; decluttering is definitely a lifelong process!

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! :) And I'd live to hear if any of you have similar experiences getting rid of guilt-inducing sentimental items.",2019-07-20 08:47:53,27,319

minimalism,Seeking advice from those of you who deleted Facebook.,"I'm curious how many of you have deleted Facebook completely -- not just deactivate but fully delete. I am very interested in doing it for the mental health reasons and because I'm sick of giving Facebook my information (I know they already have it anyway but I don't want them having any more of my data). I'm struggling because I do find Facebook useful for certain things -- like finding out about local events, party invites, and my book club communicates through a Facebook group. If I delete it, I will definitely be cut off from a lot of things. 

&#x200B;

I'm basically struggling with not wanting to participate in or support Facebook, but its so ingrained in socializing that I'll definitely miss finding out about things. I deactived it for several months a few years ago and while it was nice, I did find myself finding out about cool local events or things after they'd already happened. It's almost feeling like being on FB is a necessarily evil unless I can get the info from another source. 

&#x200B;

minimalism,"RMS lives quite a minimalistic lifestyle, but is he a good role model?","Richard Stallman (aka RMS), the founder of the free software movement. Despite being kind of a rockstar among the highly paid IT professionals, he lives actually quite a minimalistic, even ascetic lifestyle. For example, long time he didn't even have an own home, living in his MIT office. He doesn't have a cell phone (not even a dumb one). He uses an old Thinkpad T400, working primarily on the text console. He doesn't browse Web, using an email proxy instead. His websites are very plain HTML without any fancy stuff, which makes them extremely good readable and accessible ([https://stallman.org](https://stallman.org), [https://www.gnu.org/](https://www.gnu.org/)). This list could go on and on. 

But... 

Is it actually a good role model for us (young-ish) IT people? He writes on his homepage he stopped working on the actual programming projects in 2008, it's over 10 years ago. With 66 he's actually already at retirement age, but MIT still keeps him as mascot, his FSF gets quite a few bucks of donations, he probably makes some money from books etc. I mean, he might be posing as a freedom fighter, but his life in fact is and always was very secure. Before the free software movement took off, he already had a successful scientific career so never really had to worry about money etc. What's more important, he never had to worry about the relevance of his skills, which is a constant nightmare of modern IT professionals. 

So, for example, I as a software developer can't say ""I'll do all work on my pet free platform using my pet niche programming language because I think it's the best, I don't care if you disagree"". This is unprofessional and plainly stupid. Even an utopic communist society requires collaboration, responsibility and compromises. This means, I can't allow my skills to get obsolete. I can't stay on stone age hardware. I can't ignore commercial operating systems and frameworks. 

Going for science is also not an answer. I saw software projects done by scientists, they might fulfill their scientific purpose, but are built really like piles of shit. That's why society needs engineers and designers, people who create nice and functional things based on the scientific knowledge. But as an engineer or designer, if you don't have any hands on experience with the latest technology, you just can't keep up with its progress. That's one of the reasons why we use our fancy macbooks, smartphones, gaming rigs etc. But there is also a question - is the progress actually going in a right direction? Maybe it's really a good idea to take a step back and re-think it like RMS does? I have no opinion on this, and I'm hoping for a discussion. r/minimalism seems to be better suited for this than any Linux or open source themed subs.",2019-07-18 23:46:48,6,7

minimalism,Living in a hotel room for a month,"My husband and I just moved for his job, and we're selling our old house and buying a new one, so that means we have to be in a hotel room for a month. We're with our two kids and dog. We're in a junior suite, which means that the bed ""room"" is separated from the living ""room"" by a half-wall (no door).  We also have a ""kitchen"", which is a bar sink, microwave and dorm fridge.

It's dreadful in some ways, but it's also great. I've learned what we _really_ need to survive -- I made a list. I won't post it here, because it's specific to my family, but it is helpful to have such a thing because it reminds me what we actually need and not just want. 

for instance, I've lived with the same small set of clothes for the past three weeks. Which would have seemed impossible before, because I love clothes and dressing up and fashion. I can't wait to get my whole wardrobe back when the moving van comes, but I also see where I can significantly cut down on clothes -- and take care of the ones I do have. I was a big thrift store shopper, which meant I could buy lots of clothes for very cheap and toss or give them back when I was done with them. I found in this month of living simply that I prefer having a small set of clothes: I do laundry more frequently but it's WAYYYYY easier to put things back neatly and quickly when there's not as much to deal with.

Another example is furniture. Here in the hotel room we have one couch, one armchair, one bed, one desk, a dresser and a coffee table (there are three side tables, of which only one gets really used.) We didn't have a big house before, but we did have lots of chairs for friends to sit in and I was slowly upgrading from thrift-store and IKEA furniture to real grownup furniture, which meant we had an extra dining table, several extra chairs and a sofa that never got used. All that is going to go when we move into the new, smaller house.

Lastly, TOYS. OMG, my kids love *getting* toys but they don't really play with them when they have them. At the new house, I'm going to set up a system where the new toys get placed in a big box, which will go to the thrift store once a month or so. Otherwise the damn things just accumulate and no one cares until I try to persuade them to throw them out. Now its going to be ""they will go unless you specifically save them."" Well, I'll _try_ to do that, anyway. Any tips for making this work welcome!

I have found that healthy eating takes more than a microwave and a kettle. We eat a lot of takeout and microwave dinners here. That makes a lot of trash, which I'm not happy about. We throw away a kitchen bag every day, just about. Especially as the hotel doesn't have recycling. So I've put down recycling space on my ""needs"" list, even though I recognize it's really a ""want."" There are about 10 inches of countertop space at the bar sink in the ""kitchen"", and that is just not enough to chop, though it's barely enough to stir or use the one cooking bowl we use here. I can't make a meal here, so countertop space also goes on the ""needs"" list because we absolutely do need healthier food than we've been having. I have a lot of sentimental china that was on display at the old house that just wont fit in the new, so what doesn't fit on the wall is just going to have to go. I won't miss it so much because I know it's not necessary.

So those are a few of my experiences living in minimal style for a month.",2019-07-18 09:36:13,13,32

minimalism,Trying on Minimalism - An Opportunity to Experiment,"So I've been following this sub for a while as a way of continuously putting the ideas of minimalism in the forefront of my mind since I, someone who has not historically had a very minimal approach to 'stuff' and would admit to being a typical American over-consumer verging on hoarding, desire to approach the acquisition of new things and the continued possession of old things in a more mindful way. I have lots of hobbies and tons of books and records and clothes and shoes and kitchen stuff and tools and oh my god stop. Anyway, an interesting opportunity is presenting itself, actually unavoidable at this point, which will offer me the opportunity to submerge myself in minimalism and I'm both excited and a tad curious as to how this will change my life. Here's the deal. I live with a partner of 28 years and we have a big house stuffed with stuff and she's about to start a dream job here and has ties here that would make moving for her difficult, but I have just accepted a good job some 800 miles away which is great because what I do is sort of niche and finding a gig like this one is a needle in a haystack sort of thing so I'm going. So, I'm basically going to move with what I can fit in a Prius and start a new, let's call it a ""side life"", in another city with the basic aim of making money, furthering my career all while being far away from my pile of stuff. Let me assure you that I understand that just moving won't make me brilliant minimalist overnight, that I'll still be the same person in a different place. 

  I guess I'm sharing that I'm looking forward to the opportunity to have some distance, to reevaluate my values and priorities, and to try and sort out what's important to keep in my life vs what I might be ok with letting go while I live a minimalist existence.

minimalism,Simply cleaning my room changed my life,"I was a slob for quite awhile growing up. Then when I entered into adulthood, I got exposed to a little philosophy called minimalism. After doing some reading, I decided I was gonna try and go crazy on my room. I went full minimalist, full on ascetic monk mode. I rid myself of so much clutter.

&#x200B;

And oh boy did it actually work. Who would've known that a clear room leads to a clear mind. My anxiety, stress, and brain fog all decreased. I felt like my room had a purpose. My bed here, this is where I sleep. My desk there, that is where I work. I became more mindful of my space. I began designing it with purpose in mind. And that small change that started with de-cluttering had made all the difference.

&#x200B;

Practicing minimalism really does have the power to be life changing. I used to sleep on it, but now I've seen the benefits for myself, and I continue to learn and experiment with implementing minimalism in my life today. Everyone should give it a shot, even if it's just a small action like cleaning your room.",2019-07-18 06:10:40,35,518
minimalism,Did u know Levi's ceo never wash his Jeans?,"It was normal to me after few uses to wash my jeans every week but apparently I'm just wrong the whole time . I just bought a 511 slim Levi's and I was wondering about washing and I discover that Levi's CEO told to never wash jeans and clean only with something light and by your own hands.


I also was wrong about the fact to have cheaper but basic jeans. Now I understand that is better to buy something more expensive with the quality so it can last longer and stop buying every few months.


For example I got basic t shirt for 3 euros the one but when I look at some good quality it cost about 10-20 euros.

minimalism,Meditation,"I went to a meditation class tonight shortly after a decluttering session, and I found lurking thoughts of it kept popping up as mental distractions. Some background: my partner and I are working towards a long term goal of moving our family abroad. I find myself thinking every so often about what I want to store with local family, what I want to sell, donate, etc. We are pretty minimalist, but this line of thinking can be overwhelming.

While my meditation teacher was leading a guided meditation and instructing us to visualize a soothing environment, I decided to work with my distracting thoughts and I literally envisioned walking through my ideal home. It had one couch big enough for movie nights; my thick wool rug; a small bookshelf; a sturdy dining table for big family dinners, and kitchen tools to make those meals; our beds; a wooden toy box; a small chest made by my grandfather; my favorite lamp, blankets, and wall hangings; and my yoga mat.

I returned home really excited to see my home with new eyes. I was actually surprised by a few favorite objects that I didn't envision in my space (including decorations picked up during travels and a unique vintage dresser that I usually get sad when I think about selling in order to move). 

It was a really helpful exercise to change my perspective. I went from looking at my current space and trying to determine whether I should keep or get rid of each possession, to instead envisioning a blank space and then deliberately and slowly filling it. (If you follow the Minimalists podcast, I think of it like a mental ""packing party."")

minimalism,"When an item doesn't ""spark joy,"" but overwhelms you with nostalgia.","So, the rule of thumb that a lot of people go by, and hasn't yet failed me personally, is to let go of anything that ""sparks joy.""Thanks, M.K.!  


Still, I was going through some things and came across some irreplaceable items from my late grandmother that are far too fragile to be displayed. She died a long time ago, and though she wasn't super present in my life, she was a special and kind person who I did love and I still miss. This isn't something that ""sparks joy, but instead gives me a pining, lonely feeling.  


I don't usually have much attachment at all to sentimental items so this isn't often an issue for me, but this thing I have of hers is so unique. I have other things from her that do spark joy and that I will undoubtedly keep, so I'm not sure why this particular object makes me so sad and whether or not it means I should keep it.

minimalism,A year into being a Minimalist.,"I've been into the minimalist lifestyle for a year now. I'm still learning new things every day. 

Just yesterday I donated a music keyboard I had been holding onto in the hopes that some day I'd learn to play piano. I just realized if I hadn't made time to learn in 2 years I likely never would. I felt so much lighter and refreshed. I realized that one way to reduce my mental ""To Do"" list is to remove goals and dead weight dreams. To me, minimalism is like pruning a plant so that the main stem grows stronger. 

I have found saving money is really a wonderful bonus of minimalism. I finally have a positive net worth for the first time in 10 years. I enjoy the relaxation that comes with being in the positive. This sounds like FIRE but its almost entirely because I stopped buying ""Collectibles"" and expensive computer equipment. In fact, when my monitor was glitiching I replaced the cable instead of buying a new monitor and it works fine! A savings of at least 1000$. Its the minimalistic value of avoidance of buying things that caused me to look for a thrifty solution. 

My belongings fit in a small one room apartment. I get rid of more things than I buy. I often review minimalism audiobooks for inspiration. I feel such huge feelings of relief. The stuff I still own I really love. I'm okay with having books and plants. And if I have to buy something I do a quick search like ""Worlds most ethical shoes"" and I have the financial flexibility to spend a little more for ethical soundness. (For those curious the most ethical shoes are Blackspot Unswooshers. They're very comfy.)

I just think I'm just getting started with Minimalism. I am curious about what it would feel like to live with even less. I'm thinking intensely about what I really need to be happy. I'm not sure what the emotional logic really is... But so far my happiness has gone up directly with how much I get rid of. I wonder if that trend continues or if there is a minimum number of things I need to be happy. And I wonder how close I am to that. 

Overall my life satisfaction has shot up since decluttering and I am so grateful for communities like this one where I can find support for this rebellion against consumerism. :)

minimalism,Parents Refuse to Declutter,"We recently moved from a big house (4 floors, tall ceilings), to a much smaller house (2 floors, staircases I can't fit through without having to duck). All of the big furniture from our old house was moved into our new house, and arranged in a very tightly spaced way. As you can imagine, this poses a **huge problem** for me, since I'm a very meticulous, organized person.

**Example of complete and utter clutter:**

1. A very large couch blocking 80% of the entrance to the living room
2. Another couch in the basement blocking three storage cupboards
3. 30% of my dresser being inaccessible because my bed it blocking it
4. My sister's dresser being unable to open completely because HER bed is blocking it
5. Having to leave toilet paper, tissues, and paper towel rolls in the main hallway out in the open because there's absolutely **no** storage space
6. Not being able to walk anywhere without stepping on something in the basement

... and many more.

Now here's the **REAL** problem. Our house has turned into a storage unit. Anything that's taking up space, we don't use.

**More examples:**

1. The treadmill is currently unplugged and unused in the main entrance because we can't fit it through the doorway
2. We have 5 couches and definitely don't need that many
3. 8 pots and pans stored under the sink
4. Many random vases holding absolutely nothing and generally being an eyesore
5. A million bedsheets and towels that take up all three of the large cupboards in the basement
6. A million toys my sister never plays with in the basement
7. A large pile of clothes that my parents plan to donate ""someday"" (it's been like a year and a half and they're still taking up space in the main entrance

... and MANY more.

**Now, my parents refuse to throw anything away because:**

1. They plan to move into a new, larger house when I move out (I'm 14) and are keeping all the furniture for the larger house.
2. Hoarder's disease. I found some old cushion covers the other day that haven't seen the light of day since forever. When I told my parents that I was going to get rid of them, they replied, ""no! We can still use them!""
3. Money insecurities. My parents grew up in poor families and even though they have a relatively stable income, they refuse to get rid of things from untouched plastic Ikea spoons to a million random cables that ""may be important"".

My house has become completely unbearable to live in. Mess, mess, mess, and even when I try to clean, the mess magically pops back up.

*""In a neat house, there's a place for everything, and everything has its place.""*

Hahaha.

However. The problem goes deeper than that.

**Here are my main conflictions:**

1. My parents moved to the new house for me. We came to this area because it was closer to my new school and would shorten my commute from 2 hours to 40 minutes. So technically, because of me, we are now living in a tiny house.
2. My parents are very hard workers. They come home and immediately collapse on the couch to rest. At times they go to sleep right after dinner because of their horrendous work schedule. All for their children. I don't want to stress them out more with trivial things like furniture placement.
3. I love my parents and don't want to complain about everything all the time!
4. *Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut*
5. I hate hate hate this house. Like, I wake up, go downstairs, and am instantly in a bad mood because of the awful, awful clutter.

minimalism,Frugality in my own terms," 

>*I posted this in the frugal reddit, but it seems that it was the wrong forum to ask this question. I try here.*

First, sorry for my grammar as English is not my first language.

I have a normal life with at normal/high income and a normal expenses like the phone bill, the mortgage and student loan. I have also a few subscriptions and nothing more. No fancy houses, no fancy cars, no childrens. I am 36 years old and feel like my life needs to change. I feel empty inside. When I was young I didn’t have so much money as I have now and I was happy. Very very happy. I had just a few things and I appreciated each and everyone of these things. Now I can buy whatever I want whenever I want and don’t use it or just use one or two times and them buy another thing. I love technology, books, comic books and video games and for my, my hobbies are very important. As a teacher, I need them to get back the energy I spend under the day socializing with hundreds of people. I just love to come home to my wife, spend time with her and read, or play. I can say that I just need this kind of hobbies in my live, but they don’t take over, just complement it.

Over the years I have been accumulating a lot of material things like comics, books and video games and my shelf space has been decreasing at a fast pace. I often sit and look at my shelves and wonder what I have become. What has happened and why I’m in this situation. I have everything I wanted and I’m not happy. Not as happy as I should be with all my things. I have spend a lot of money also. But I now what I must do. I must embrace frugality but in my own terms.

If I get rid of everything I will feel miserable, because I love this things. Not the material things, as I thought, but what I get from them. And this is one of the rules of minimalism, keep the things that sparks joy. But I don’t want to keep the “things”, because the cause me stress, but the “sensations”.

And this is where I need help.

The plan is as it follows:

Video Games: Digital gaming in a budget. Maybe just choose a few day one game for a full price and the rest, just wait until a digital sale. Often the physical games are cheaper than the digital so here is the problem. Maybe I just buy games and sell them? I don’t know...

Comic books: digital too. Marvel Unlimited? I don’t see any other cheap options where I live (Sweden).

Books: Kindle. The often are cheaper than physical in the new book section. I can use the library also. I love the library.

Music: I love vinyl. I have a big collection and this is something that I have mixed feelings. I love music. I love quality sound. I cant just buy cheap headphones and listen to too compressed music. I have Spotify and its ok (if the headphones are ok) but I’m not sure if I want to get rid of my vinyls.

Movies: Netflix.

You maybe have better alternatives that mine and can help me with this. Thanks everyone for reading this long post!",2019-07-17 13:06:42,4,6

PC, monitor, keyboard etc. \[X\]

I also collect some merchandise for a videogame I like. Owning this stuff (literally a book, a domino set and a figure) stresses me out.

I know some people with much more than me; phone, ipad, macbook, PC, TV, games console, mega collection of F1, vinyl collection, electric guitar; BUT, they experience no stress from this.

I can't just chuck away my iPad and laptop, especially as the iPad was from Christmas. I would rather get use from it for it to break instead of selling it.

&#x200B;

Also, the reasons I want to be a minimalist are:

&#x200B;

\-Stress from owning 'stuff'

\-More stuff means more management, less free time

\-Buying more stuff, or some stuff which requires maintenance, increases living costs which are already high.

&#x200B;

I've always been a hoarder, and getting rid of things is difficult because I'm convinced I'll need things in the future. Not only that, but I really don't like throwing things that work fine into the bin, as it's such a waste. My man cave is the messiest room in the house, with stacks of old CD's, mounds of vintage film cameras and lenses, and old crap that I never seemed to want to throw away. Rather than attempt to tackle this pit of a room and give up, I wanted to start with a small victory to get the ball rolling. Something where I'd be able to see good results quickly.

minimalism,Discussion on Essentialism - The disciplined pursuit of less,"Hi, I'm not sure where else to post this and can't seem to find much online either (most of them talk about the other essentialism). I've just read the book by Greg Mckeown and I'm definitely drawn to the ideas or concept that he is selling but (ironically because the very first step he said is to explore your options), I feel like I should explore what could be the opposition to such ideas?

minimalism,Email Clutter - ideas for coping with it,"Hello!

Just wondering if anyone had can share their tips/tricks/ideas of ways that you deal with email clutter. For instance, I hate dealing with email ads from different companies and yet, I don't want to simply unsubscribe because they will often send email-only coupon codes. Now, when I do legitimately need to purchase something, I like having the codes for the savings they offer but I don't want to see the emails ads filling my inbox all the time. I feel like if I can avoid seeing things I don't need and I’ll be less tempted to purchase. In addition, I don’t want to even archive them as it's more clutter and a complete waste of digital space since most of the sales are time sensitive and won’t be of any use in a week or two. So, I'm thinking of creating a filter and sending all my promotion type emailed directly to trash. They will stay there for 30 days then get automatically deleted. This means if I'm needing to make a purchase or want to browse a newsletter/promo email, I can just do a search in the trash but otherwise, my inbox would stay much less congested. I’ve done this some and it works fairly well.

However, before I do this for a bunch more of my emails, I'm looking for additional suggestions from the community for all types of email clutter. Any other ideas that folks could share regarding how your deal with these issues? I'd love to hear! Thanks in advance!",2019-07-15 23:28:52,6,1

minimalism,Changing my Coffee Habit,"I wanted to talk about how changing one simple habit made a huge impact on my life.  


I used to go through the starbucks drive through every morning before work.  I would get a small coffee and a breakfast sandwich 5 times a week.  In addition I'd get an afternoon coffee from the cafe in my work about three times a week.  At the start of 2019 my husband and I started down the path to FIRE (financial independence and retire early) and that involved critically examining our spending habits and figuring out where we could minimize.  I realized my lazy breakfast habits were costing us almost $1,500 per year!  On top of that my husband was buying daily coffees as well, so it was really adding up, not to mention all of the waste from the disposable cups....  


So our first big switch was to start brewing coffee at home and not getting to-go breakfasts.  This cut our yearly spending down to $520.  We saved a grand just by taking a few minutes at home.  However I still would go for afternoon coffees at my work, which still created a lot of waste.  I recently found some instant coffee that I love that has 100 cups for $20.  I'm going to start using that to replace my afternoon coffee, which at 0.20/cup vs 1.60 will bring my total coffee/breakfast bill to $320/year, saving me almost $1,200.  


The thing is, it really isn't that big of a deal to make these changes.  It's giving up a little bit of convenience and time (tho to be honest making coffee at home usually takes a lot less time than the line at starbucks) and saving so much!  It's encouraging me to try and see what other small habits i can tweak to save money and waste.  (I'm thinking skincare will be next)",2019-07-15 10:41:02,108,367

minimalism,"If you’re new to minimalism or struggle with it, we can help support your effort to not buy anything during Amazon Prime Day.","Every year we hear about how much stuff was bought during Amazon Prime day and it’s safe to say most of it was not needed. Here are some things I do to resist buying anything. Please share other ideas you have. 

1.  I keep an wishlist of things I want but know I don’t need (I.e. a Bluetooth speaker) and things I will need in the future (I.e. new socks). Since I don’t want or buy many things, it’s hard for family to shop for me during birthday and Christmas. I need to wait to buy things I’ll need and give my family my list or else I’ll end up with something I don’t want or need which will end up donated. 

2. Buy only the brands you really want. Yes, that polo shirt on Amazon looks okay and it’s only $7 which is a great deal, but is not the one I really want. I think many people end up with so much stuff because they think “wow, this is a great deal”. What you should be looking for is something you’ll love. I own two pairs of outlier slim dungarees. 10 years ago I would have balked at anyone who spends that much money on pants. But the truth is I love them. They are the only pants I need except for work pants. I’m not going to buy something just because it’s cheap. I also only need two, not 20. Many things you only need on or two of, not multiples. 

3.  Think about the total costs. Yes, that widget might look nice on my desk at work but is $50. I donate money to Seva, and Seva can perform cataract surgery for someone in need in Asia for $50. That’s value. It also have environmental costs. It took fossil fuels to mine the materials, make it, ship it. There’s packaging that will be thrown away. It’s not worth the total cost.",2019-07-15 05:52:57,0,9

minimalism,I’ve been keeping track of all of the clothing items I’ve purchased in 2019. Here’s what I’ve bought so far,"I’m a mid-twenty’s lady, if that matters: 

Totally new clothing items; 

Alpaca yarn (used to knit a new sweater) 


Equal replacement (I only bought these items to replace worn out items)

1 pair runners 

2 pairs leggings 

2 balls of yarn (for socks)

I've always orbited a minimalistic lifestyle and now I feel as if I'm ready to do it!  


I have way to much stuff -- just to much. Bags of clothing I've worn and some never. Almost two closest filled with shoes. Cabnets just -- filled. 

Here is my issue. I am on a time frame. Lets just say I have 3 days to get this all cleared up. How do I make money off of these purchses I've made years ago ? 
I've looked into the consignments and there aren't any in my area that don't spill over into 'boutique'/partial snob.

The majority of the stuff i have isn't high end name brands but nor is it garbage. Yet that is the issue with consignments. They want the niche/pricy items only. Most of the stuff I am done with is unworn Nike or just barely worn decent looking clothing. It's perfect for the world of Ross/Goodwill yet neither buy clothing for cash. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go the online route.....
What do I do ? I just dont want to donate everything. 
I want to be able to make a profit off of this some how.",2019-07-14 18:16:08,12,2
minimalism,A Minimalist experiment: digital and social media detox. (Beginning of the journey!),"Hello r/minimalism and fellow minimalists.

Lately I have been feeling quite addicted to my devices giving me tons of lost or “dead” hours, that have been on social media as a whole (YouTube, Reddit, Facebook and Twitter) spending over 6hrs (sometimes 7hrs) of on-screen time on my iPad, that’s truly ridiculous!. 

Also, this past week I also have been experiencing eye strain giving me some horrible headaches and a general dry-eye sensation. The reasons are obvious, spending upwards of 6hrs looking at a screen is not good for my mental and physical health. 

Spending this amount of time has led me to retake bad habits, such as going to sleep late and dismissing my alarm every morning (I tried going to sleep around 11pm and wake up at 8am) and that leads to some procrastination and to bad eating habits, therefore not hitting the GYM the days I used to. It has been horrible, I know all this things and I am conscious that a change needs to be done so this will be a mental challenge. 

**Objectives and expectations**

My main objective is, getting rid of my eye strain. Besides that, I am looking into improving my health overall what this means is eating well again and getting my sleep fixed. A nice bonus will be to have new ways of entertainment during the time I will be replacing, music seems like a good idea and also reading again. Also I can try new things and once that I am kind of settled, I can also start new habits. I think it’s a great idea to start watching a new TV-Series and go through it one hour before going to sleep.

By getting rid of excessive usage of my devices I expect to be more mindful, calm and productive. Getting rid of the fear of missing out will be the most difficult thing and following that, will be those moments of “not doing nothing”. I also expect a boost in general productivity and being constantly moving, looking for things to do. 

**Planning and execution**

Here is what I have in mind. I think it is important to be gradual on this, so for the first weeks I will have the Screen-On Time feature set to 30 min per day to each app that I am addicted to and on the second half of the challenge reduce that gap to 15 min. Also, all video content like Netflix or HBO will be exclusive to the computer and the hand held devices should have the apps limited. Also, implement rigorously what I know as “minimalist morning & nights”.

Some other things that I plan to do are:

- **Set up app limits.** Firstly go 30 minutes a day for each social app and two weeks after set it to 15 minutes.

- **Include minimalist mornings & nights.** Basically consists of not using any kind of electronics after the GYM or breakfast, night routine starts at 10 pm with no blue screen devices also dimming lights and dinner.

- **Do a deep digital detox.** This means cleaning up all my social media, unfollowing people, clear caches, unfollow pages, etc.

- **Write daily progress.** Each night write something about how I am feeling about this challenge and then look for progres. (Which I will report)

- **Recover old good habits.** Health is essential so eating the correct things, hitting the GYM consistently again and a good sleep habit is key.

- **Look for new hobbies or things to do.** Instead of getting bored and pick the devices to “entertain” myself. I will find new things to do, or new habits where I can spend my time.

I wanted to do this challenge for a while now, I was not able to do it because of a lack of willpower but now I have grabbed my balls and I am going to it. I believe planning al this stuff on (digital)paper makes my objectives clearer and easier to follow, also this helps when I loose some track because it reminds me what to be done. 

This challenges/detoxes helps us to think outside the box therefore getting out of our comfort zone and push us to do new stuff and get rid of the other. I am going to start it now because College starts on August and I need to be focused to not get better grades, but to be a better learner. Social media is a huge downfall if you don’t know how to use it, it can become very irritating, frustrating and “entertaining” but reality is other because procrastination and mental issues (anxiety, fear of missing out and depression) are around the corner. Stepping up and being ahead of the curve is not only going to make me a better learner but a more meaningful one, that can appreciate life outside of a phone or tablet. 

> “There is no greater education than one that is self-driven” -Neil deGrasse Tyson.

I am starting this journey today, July 14th and plan to give an update on August 14th with all the progress. If you have any question, advice or suggestion (that are much needed) please let me know it so I can make this challenge in the easiest and functional way.",2019-07-14 15:15:34,39,146
minimalism,picking an single outfit for good?,"So I was watching a video by Tom Scott where he mentions that his wardrobe is mostly made up of lots of red t-shirts, lots of jeans, and a single suit. This seems like a great idea for saving money/brain power and I've realised that I'm able to buy plain clothes online extremely cheap (£1.50 t-shirts).

Now I'm at a crossroads on what to stock for the most minimal wardrobe possible  - T-shirts? Shirts? Polo? Which is all around more practical?

&#x200B;

 Colour will also be important if I'll be sticking to just one:

Yellow/Pink: Bold and fun, might show sweat/dirt and look masculine.

White: Slimming, might show sweat/dirt

Black: Boring/simple, doesn't show sweat/dirt

Red/Blue: Good all around choice but seems a little generic?

Purple/Brow: Ugly

minimalism,What’s your packing method for long trips? (Spending a year abroad),"EDIT BELOW!

I’m about to embark on a year abroad teaching English in Hokkaido, Japan. As it’s a very cold weather area, and I’ll be needing business as well as casual attire, I’ve been struggling to keep it as minimal as possible.

I’ve limited myself to a small carry-on (about 2/3 the usual size) and a small backpack as my personal item for my laptop. This has helped me to narrow it down to only the absolute necessary, and I’m pretty happy with what I have.

Anyone else taken a long trip out of just a carry-on before? How do you like to pack?

EDIT: thank you all for your replies!! I was expecting to start a discussion, but I suppose I should’ve written more about myself!

I’m female, 5’4”, 110 lbs (so slightly tall for Japan but average weight) and wear size 8 US shoe (Japanese size 24.5, largest common size). 

I don’t currently own enough to pack two suitcases. If I brought everything I own, it would be in one medium-large suitcase, but I’ve decided to challenge myself to really go down to the basics.

I also want to add that the girl who lived in my (furnished) apartment before me is leaving some clothes behind like sweaters, etc, that are work appropriate. 

Here’s what I’m packing: 
4 business blouses (one of my T-shirts is business appropriate)
1 business skirt
1 pair of (very comfortable) business shoes
5 pairs of no-show socks
1 wool blazer (worn)

4 T-shirts (wearing one)
1 pair of jeans (wearing)
1 slim belt
8 pairs of socks
8 pairs of underwear
1 pair of leather boots (I wear these for casual wear daily, and they work well for hiking and long-distance walking in all weather; wearing on plane)
2 Heattech undershirts
1 pashmina scarf
1 pair warm gloves
1 Northface fleece jacket (worn)

Laptop and charger
12 packs medication (I’ve filled out the proper form)
Phone charger
1 outlet converter
Carry-on sizes of toiletries (toothpaste, hair cream, lotion, foundation)
Toothbrush
3 sticks deodorant
Small folder with forms and important information printed
4 Omiyage (tiny jars of jam from my hometown to give to board of education advisors, mayor, and Japanese Teacher of English I will be working with)

Bracelet (sentimental item from my mom)
Necklace (sentimental item from my partner)

Things I will buy there:
Winter coat, used (mine is very old and definitely not warm enough for the full season)
Winter hat (same reason as above)
2 pairs professional pants for winter (do not currently own)
5 white heattech extra warm undershirts (currently own black, so they will not go with work shirts)
Indoor shoes (shoes worn to work at my school in Japan, crocs will do)
Large sizes of shampoo, conditioner, lotion
3DS with animal crossing

A couple weeks ago I got a job offer in an another state. The offer is contingent on a couple of things and salary negotiations are in process. This is a very slow, bureaucratic organization. I applied for the job in March 2019. It is mid-July and I suspect I could have upwards of two more months of limbo. And this is if things keep moving forward in the hiring process, as they could collapse anytime with or without notice and leave me to start over. I am willing to go through this chaos because if I get this job it'll be a sweet life!

&#x200B;

I had hoped to make the new job start when my apartment lease ended. Not the case. haha

So my lease was supposed to end July 14 at noon. Today I got it extended to July 31. After that I could end up in virtually any combination of the following scenarios:

\-Extending my lease another month (though this is highly doubtful)

\-Getting an Air BnB in my current city and keeping my dog at my sis's house across town

\-Getting an Air BnB with my dog ($$$)

\-Staying in my sis's spare room for a week (she has a husband and two babies, so it would be hectic there)

\-Staying 2 or 3 days with a friend

\-Getting a sublet from someone with 2-4 months left on the lease

\-Moving to a different state and getting an apartment (but living out of an Air Bnb while I find the new apartment)

They bring us value to our marriage obviously but one has to wonder if three of four whips or ball gags are really necessary when only one could be typically used at a time.

minimalism,I'm Moving. Should I put my items in storage?,"I'm a recent college graduate and next month I am moving to California to start a year long internship. They provide housing, food as well as provide a stipend. Housing includes a private bedroom with a bed, desk, chair, lamp and wardrobe. I will share common areas such as the living room and kitchen, which are also furnished, with the other interns. I currently rent a townhome and own a bed, dresser, desk, couch, bookshelf, tv & stand, kitchen table, dish set as well as some decor I've mindfully selected over the last two years of living here. Here is what I am struggling with... do I store these items in a storage unit for the next year or should I sell them?

&#x200B;

Everything that I use regularly or really value will be coming with me. I am struggling with the pros and cons. Part of me wants to let go of these items, so that I am not attached to them or a place so when my internship is up I am free to take another similar opportunity or travel. Another part of me really likes these items as they are all in good condition and it would costs a lot of money to replace them if I do decide to settle somewhere after my internship.

&#x200B;

I would love to hear some thoughts!

EDIT: After some advice in the comments, I decided to put some numbers to it.

Storing for the year would costs around $1,200 and moving the items long distance can run anywhere between $1,000-$2,000. I would value my items at $1,200.

minimalism,A few comments about the book Digital Minimalism . Advice is welcomed!,"So I finished reading Cal Newport's book ""Digital Minimalism"" and have been committed to following the framework it contains. My life has improved in many aspects, but a few concerns have also popped up. 

&#x200B;

These are concerns that also go with minimalism in general when you are required to live with or interact with other people, but I'd like to hear your thoughts. 

&#x200B;

1. The hardest part about Digital Minimalism is that nobody else is doing it. That is, nobody I interact with has chosen to stop being a slave to their screens. So there are some really awkward moments where I have every intention to NOT use my phone while everyone around me ends up glued to theirs. What's the next step in this situation? 

&#x200B;

2. Having deep conversations (either in person or by phone) vs connection (via email or social media) simply doesn't work for my job, where I'm handling many dozens of emails per workday with people who aren't on the same work hours (i.e. they live overseas). Calling or meeting people would not only be impractical but would consume days or weeks of time, rather than a day. Not only that, but the majority of people will tell me that email is the best way to communicate with them. How do you guys manage this? 

&#x200B;

3. I've developed near-hostility to those around me. Not that I've lashed out at anyone (yet), but being more aware about just how distracted people are with their devices makes me hyper-sensitive to it. It wouldn't really bother me (or perhaps I just wasn't in tune) with how much time my son and wife spend on their phones. Even while doing things together, they always have to check Facebook or Instagram... I was never one to do this outright, but now it's really getting on my nerves to see how distracted they are. How do you overcome this? 

&#x200B;

I mean, in general, the book and philosophy of Digital MInimalism can be ""easy"" if all you had to concern yourself with is you - but I can't seem to make things go smoother when everyone else is on a completely different wavelength.

Any tips and advice would be greatly appreciated.",2019-07-10 08:06:54,23,8
minimalism,The best way to get rid of old paintings?,"Hello Reddit!

I'm new here, and I'm also quite new to minimalism.
For the past few months I've been de-cluttering all my belongings and now everything I've ever owned fits nicely in one room (I live in a two bedroom apartment with a roommate so I only have one room for myself).

Now I've found a problem of where to put all my art ""paintings"". Painting is one of my main hobbies for the past 2 years. I'm not a professional or even that good, I just like the way it makes me feel. But where do I put all the amateur paintings?

I've hung a few that I like on the walls and I always suggest my guests or family members to take one with them if they see one they like (which they actually do sometimes). But I've still got a bunch of old ones that no one cares about just lying around. What is the best option here? I can't make myself throw them out because I've put a lot of time into making them and now I'm wandering how in a few years my room will be filled with only useless paintings..

Anyone have the same problem or a suggestion what to do?

Also, sorry for the mistakes, not an English speaker here. 

*Not painting is not an option here. I've put quite a lot of money, bought a hand crafted easel and I buy good quality art supplies. I just love this hobby too much and wouldn't be who I am without it.",2019-07-10 02:04:11,17,3
minimalism,Children raised on minimalism,"Was anyone here raised in a minimalist setting? It often seems to me that my own interest in minimalism is a result of having known what it is like to have much and to live a lifestyle indulging in the comforts offered by excess. I don’t mean to say extreme wealth, but extreme capitalistic participation within the level of my family’s income bracket. I know what it is to find life lacking within that life and believe that while minimalism will not fill that emptiness, it will allow me to better pour my excess to those without the minimum needed for comfort or life. 
Really the question is, how possible is it to learn to desire less if you never experience more? This seems to show up in societal trends as it is not until an era of people finding identity through ownership of goods/property reached its high point that we begin to see people identifying instead with a lack of interest in such things (either in an aesthetic way or a practical one). So, if you were raised in a minimalist setting, I would love to hear what that journey looked like and whether the values of minimalism were easily passed on to you or if you had to first go through a period of experiencing more.",2019-07-10 00:10:57,18,28
minimalism,Advice needed: How to take it to the next level?,"I understand that minimalism isn't something with a certain pre-set target that I have to achieve. I know that I don't HAVE to get rid of more things, but EVERY time that I trim down things in my life, I enjoy what remains more. I keep making excuses for keeping things I don't use. Oh that was expensive. Oh my mom gave that to me. I forgot I had that, ill start using it now! Oh I cant get rid of that!

I've gotten rid of so many things in the past, don't miss a single item. Part of me knows that I could have a fire take everything away and I'd be totally fine without it, life would go on. Yet I cant seem to part with so many things. I'm a big believer in your perspective is your reality. Sometimes just viewing something differently can really change your mindset. What questions do you ask yourself or what do you think about when you have trouble getting rid of something.

Challenge level: he doesn't like much & has health issues. Spaghetti is the closest thing to ""foreign"" food he'll eat. He hates ground turkey, but has heart issues.

He doesn't worry about gender roles & isn't opposed to cooking. He just never had any need to before. We're trying to gently ease him into the habit.

minimalism,"Advice/commiseration: I want us to go more minimalist, wife is resistant.","My wife and I have moved on average once every 2 years for the past 20 years. We're in our late 40s and it has gotten *old*. That said, we may need to move again after this next one, and it seems to me that the best thing we could do is pare down our possessions. We don't necessarily have to go total minimalist, but we could do a lot better than this.

(I heard of a bachelor once who, after an arduous move, decided that he'd only own what he could fit in a small car and pack by himself in one hour. Envy!).

The problem is, my wife is very resistant. She has about 2,000 books (from library bag sales), of which she has *maybe* read 4% (and usually read library borrows anyway). I'm not great, either, as I have about 300 books (down from a previous about 600 I'd guess), a milk crate of records, and old cassettes, etc. My wife also has a lot of clothes, maybe 50 pairs of shoes. We probably have about 10 blankets, far more plates/forks/etc than we need, and other junk that I am trying to get rid of this week as we prepare for a move.

I think we could get down to 200 good books each, reduce our wardrobes by 50%, digitize music, simplify the kitchen stuff, etc. so that the move *after this one* could go a *lot* easier.

But my wife is resistant to part with her books, clothes, etc. She has gotten rid of some books, but it's like 20-40 out of 2000 and that has taken a couple of years. She also has probably 3-4 large cardboard boxes of old papers, notes, etc., none of which she hardly ever refers back to.

minimalism,Verbal Clutter,"Yesterday I was hanging out with a couple of old and close friends. We went to a bar and had a few beers. Afterward, we went to one of my friend's house and started to talk.

&#x200B;

I was slightly tipsy but still conscious of my actions. During the conversation, I made a very inappropriate comment about one of my friends. I really don't know why I said it, but it was a foolish action. Fortunately, my friend was in another room and the rest of my friends apparently did not pay any attention since I was quickly interrupted and was not able to properly finish that offensive comment.

&#x200B;

After I when back home, I started to ask myself why sometimes I make this kind of insensible loudmouth comments. Why do I complain constantly, gossip of unimportant topics or say more of what I should?

&#x200B;

For the last year, I have embraced minimalism as a way to live a significant life. I constantly make an effort to avoid irresponsible spending, part with objects that are no longer relevant in my life, declutter my digital and physical life, etc.

&#x200B;

However, I hadn't really thought about the verbal clutter we utter. Gossip, lies, insensible jokes, offensive comments; many of them without the intention of hurting others. Why do we (or at least me in this circumstance) express in such unmeaningful and unpleasant way from time to time?

&#x200B;

I realize that as we curate our minimalistic life, we must also declutter and properly curate our voice. Expressing many words does not mean we express deeper or useful thoughts.

&#x200B;

There is a popular expression that says: only speak if your words are better than silence. Just as we think twice or thrice before buying an object, it is important to mediate of what and how we say things and if the will be meaningful to our listeners, regardless of who they are.

I have a bed, nightstand/bookshelf, cart for my medical things, prayer mat, Qur'an, and stationery, a tiny couch, a little overbed c-shaped table I use as a desk, and a little side table that I use for sewing/knitting supplies. However, I constantly feel as though I have too many things: I have greatly minimized in the last week, and rearranged my entire room.  However,  I still feel like I have way too many things. Any advice?

Edit: I recently got rid of the nightstand which is a huge win! I really did not need it, and all of the things that were in it can comfortably fit in the rest of my furniture. My sister recently moved into my room with me and it has been working out fairly well: we jerry-rigged a little impromptu murphy bed that flips out of the closet, which isn't too much of a hassle for me or her :)

minimalism,"Need Advice, moved from 100 SQFT tiny apt to 500 sqft big open space apartment, no furniture right now.","Need some advice.. 

I was sleeping on a couch that had a fold out bed in my last place which I had about 100SQFT of livable space. It was pretty close to a micro studio. I upgraded to a ""normal"" studio and its I think 500 SQFT, in this big Rectangle of a room with the kitchen on one wall. I sold my couch, and ended up buying a Japanese floor bed. I was planning to do furniture free, hence the roll up Japanese futon style floor bed because I didn't know what this place looked like until I was able to move into it. I assumed it was going to be as small as my last place, and I couldn't even lay on the floor without touching the wall or my couch, I was doing the roll up bed to have more space.  I've never had this much space, its like a big master bedroom in a house in size, but the kitchen is on one wall. I really like the space, its nice to be able to move around, and I could like stick my arms out and spin and jump and never hit a wall or ceiling. If I have people over we have no where to sit and eat but the floor. My mattress (Japanese futon) is on the floor. While I like the minimalism of no furniture, I can't help but think people will think I'm a psycho or something if they come to my apartment and I have zero furniture and a mattress on the floor. I'm trying to figure out a solution that stays minimalist, looks good, but allows a place to sit. I thought about getting those cheap plastic tables that have swing out legs, went to the store and felt to cheap and low quality. I like quality. Come moving time, I hate having to move stuff. Right now the apartment feels like an open warehouse, I like that, but need places to sit and eat and a little work bench that I can solder/code on a computer/build stuff. Not sure how to approach this. I don't own much (fit everything I owned into the back of an SUV when moving). I like the Japanese mattress which works for me solo, but I worry a girl would see mattress on the floor and be like ""WTF"". It's firm and easily rolls up into the closet. Not sure where to go from here. I thought about pillows and having people sit on the floor, but really if I bring people over are they going to be like ""WTF, this guy is a psycho""  or ""whats wrong with him, he doesn't own furniture."". If I had all the money in the world I'd probably throw black gloss baby grand in the corner, eames lounge chair, ect. I love high quality but I don't own that much and for a reason, I like minimalism in the aspect of its cheap living. Not sure where to go from here. Went and looked at furniture but I didn't like the idea of having to figure out how to move it, spending $$$$, it taking up my big open space I have now. Torn between not wanting furniture and not wanting to appear like a psycho when I have people over lol. advice?",2019-07-07 14:08:19,12,8

minimalism,An object that define minimalism for you ?,"Hey everyone,

What do you have in mind ? Share it I am curious !

Warning : Apple propaganda incoming...
For me it has to be Apple’s AirPods. As I listen to music all day long these have changed the way I experience my library. Why do they represent minimalism to me ? Because they are lightweight, case included, the design is clear and precise. They may be one of the symbol of the current cloud based music era. Once you have them on you even forget them and can enjoy the sound with a great sense of freedom : you don’t have to worry about your listening system at any time. That is one part removed from the whole equation of listening to music, only the sound is left. 

*end of propaganda*
A little downside which is not that minismalist : I would consider myself as an audiophile so I still need a solid pair of wired headphones for better sound quality when it comes to active listening sessions. Nevertheless the sound quality of AirPods is decent (kind of a sweet spot where I would not focus that much on the music) for passive listening at the office or when reading.

Had a lot of books I didn't read but someday want to...This is my biggest challenge in minimalism.,2019-07-02 18:36:40,20,16
minimalism,Any thoughts on steady-state economies?,"As a minimalist who thinks too much, I think about the impact of minimalism, consumerism, etc on the larger society.  Most rich societies use an economic system that is based on infinite economic growth.  So, consumerism is glorified and encouraged.  This, I think, is unsustainable.  Granted, it seems that any relatively complex society will eventually use up resources.  However, societies with an imperative of infinite economic growth and encouragement of consumerism are much more likely to use up resources waaaaaay faster.  I have read a little about ""steady-state"" economies which are ""an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital)  and a constant population size. In effect, such an economy does not grow  in the course of time.""

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state\_economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_economy)

&#x200B;

I believe that growth-obsessed economies eventually will hit a wall and be forced to become steady-state economies to some degree.  An intentional steady-state economy interests me... does anyone have any thoughts on it?  How feasible would it be?  What problems come to mind?  I'm just curious.",2019-07-02 15:22:44,24,2

minimalism,Your storage container(s) of choice?,"I’ve never had many containers (compared to non-minimalist people?) because I never accumulated much stuff and due to moving somewhat often

Now, I’m kind of settling down in a specific corner of the world and would like to have “containers” that I can put my knick-knacks in. Almost all of the knick-knacks I have are useful that I use at least once every six months.

Right now, these things are sitting neatly sorted in multiple freezer bags. E.g. I put all excess stationary supplies (ruler, calculator, spare staples) in a bag. I put all “electronics” related things (batteries, cords, manuals) in another bag. There is a small size freezer bag for clothing repair/sewing kit with needles, ripper, threads. A larger freezer bag with all first aid supplies and medicines I own (not much).

These various bags are sitting on the top shelf of my limited space closet.

Now, I’m thinking of how to store them. Buy a little unit with drawers (like Ikea Alex)? Put them in transparent boxes (Sterilite, or Ikea Samla)? Buy a shelf to then stack the bins onto? Leave them in freezer bags in the same closet?

Money is an issue so I can’t go crazy organizing with various styles of containers that cost $15 each.

minimalism,The most valuable present you can give,"This month 2 of my best friends since childhood turn 30. I was thinking about gifts for them since last year and this morning it hit me.

I will share my memories with them. 

I wrote them both a letter each. Writing down the most memorable moments, describing in detail what I remember. What did it smell like, how did I feel, what feelings did they show and so on. The most personal moments we shared. The moments that defined our friendship.

I also picked up an every day item for them. For one friend for example it is a specific tea. Because when I see that specific tea I think of her.

Thank you Minimalism for getting me into a mindset, which let me think of such a beautiful idea.",2019-07-02 13:54:10,8,85
minimalism,Tatami and Futon Combo Opinions,"Hello,

First post on the sub. Currently downsizing and moving into a very tiny three bedroom apartment later this year and was contemplating different space saving bedroom options in order to conserve the little free area that I have. Looking through different options I came upon the traditional bedding setup with a Tatami flooring and japanese futon: not only is it packable, but it would also heavily help with transportation, as I am unable to take a mattress with me and back to college. I am fairly comfortable with sleeping on the floor and would actually like to sleep closer to the ground (don't particularly like bedframes), and this seems to meet all the options. 
I'm looking at an IKEHIKO Tatami and a Luxton Home futon on Amazon, but I'm also trying to keep costs as low as I can: if anyone has experience with more affordable and comparable options, please let me know. Looking for thoughts, opinions, and advice on this setup.
Thanks!",2019-07-02 11:20:23,3,6

minimalism,I got rid of things that I really valued and now I regret it.,"In the past 2 years, in the name of minimalism, I have gotten rid of much of my clothing, books, and other assorted items. I was never a messy person or a hoarder, and many of these items were things I did actually like a lot, but they were never or rarely used. Recently I have gone looking for some of the things I liked and I have apparently given them away and gotten rid of them. 

For example, I looked for a pair of jeans I had once purchased. They were unworn and had embroidery on them. I had purchased them at the same time as another pair of jeans and I decided I would hold onto the embroidery jeans until I needed to use new pair of pants. The time came yesterday when I was looking for these jeans and apparently I got rid of them. 

I also looked recently for a Keychain my brother gave me when he was a child. It was a heart shaped Keychain that said ""#1 Sister"" on it. And for whatever reason in my stupid head, I have apparently given this away too. I didn't use it on my own Keychain because it was large and bulky but I loved it  because it was from my little brother. It was one of 2 things he has ever given me.

I have looked recently for other shirts and also my favorite book, and have determined that I gave these things away. I did most of my downsizing from 2 years - 1 year ago, so I don't totally remember all the things I have gotten rid of until I look for them and they aren't here. 

I am so angry with myself for getting rid of things I really loved, wanted, and valued, just because I didn't use them (not using them yet, or they were items that I didn't use often but still loved).

I am really regretting my choice to get rid of these things. I tried this minimalist approach so I would not feel burdened by my material items and clothing. I never actually did feel burdened though. And now I feel a great loss.

The items are long lost to time and donation drop-boxes, so I can't possibly get them back. I would suggest to people here to reconsider heavily for a while before you get rid of things you really love but don't use. 

I would have worn the pair of pants eventually, but I convinced myself I was making excuses to hold onto them and would feel less burdened if I got rid of them. I loved my copy of my favorite book (as well as the rest of my collection of books) but convinced myself I could be more free if I didn't have so many books weighing me down. I loved the Keychain from my little brother, but I told myself I never used it and was wasting space by holding on to it.

Just because you don't use something, it doesn't mean you never will. Just because something sits around and you look at it occasionally doesn't mean you will be better off without it. Don't get rid of things as an impulse decision. Think for a while before you donate/get rid of your possessions.",2019-07-02 04:37:30,87,477
minimalism,Hoarding Memories,"We have this amazing quality to remember things. Memories of loved ones, big events, as well as all the ordinary happy times! There are also some not so great memories which have been lessons for us, something to grow from.

I'm not very attached to items and I have been decluttering many years. Just now, I have felt how relaxing my apartment feels. So light, only the meaningful items being there. *But there is still something weighing me down, and has been.* For a long time I tried to figure out what was it, why was I feeling so anxious despite the physical clear space?

Then it got to me. **I'm a mental hoarder.**   
I have a slight obsession to write down everything important to my journal and ...not so important, also to take photos of everything, and later on it is very hard to delete them. From ordinary foods to random plants. Everything. Tbh this creates physical clutter too but I don't view it as such.

I realized that I'm going to try to be more intentional, because after all, that's what minimalism is about. Living with intention. 

I don't know if some of you are dealing with this or have been, but remember to look at inside of you and see if there too, is something to declutter. 

I would appreciate if you have any tips for how to let go of the fear of not remembering stuff. Or have you experienced anything similar?",2019-07-02 04:30:00,2,6

I'm a PhD candidate at Duke University, and for my dissertation, I am studying the lives of people who practice minimalism. I'm looking at how and why people are drawn to lifestyles of owning less and how it affects their lives.

Some of my research includes conducting surveys and in-depth interviews. That's where I'm hoping you'll come in.

Even if you don't want to do an interview, **would you be a part of [this survey](https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bCKhyTneEW5KyDH?Q_CHL=social&Q_SocialSource=reddit) on minimalism?** It takes about 10 minutes or so.

If you practice minimalism as a lifestyle, are an adult in the U.S., and might be interested in letting me interview you, you can leave your email address at the end of the survey. You can also get more info about what we're doing and get some idea of who you'll be talking to by going here: https://sites.duke.edu/minimalismstudy/

minimalism,Would You Ever Use a Minimalistic Smartphone?,"I [made a video about this topic](https://youtu.be/fxZwyUlD3bI) if you would rather watch than read.

Recently, I heard about about a device called the Light Phone 2. I'm sure some of you saw the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-jamNT9CkY&t=1s) that came out for it.

This phone is basically a dumbphone with a more minimalist design and was created with with the intention of being a TOOL and not a device for entertainment, social media, distractions. That being said, it only features calling, texting, an alarm app, basic navigation, and that's about it.

To quote their IndieGogo,

>""The Light Phone 2 brings a few essential tools, like messaging and an alarm clock, so it's even easier to ditch your smartphone more often, or for good. It’s a phone that actually respects you"".

Their aim here is to get people OFF their phone and more immersed in the world going on around them. An ambitious goal in the age of peak social media.

I really think this phone will have some 'freeing' power for its users. You would be able to be in contact with people and go about your daily needs without ever having to worry about being distracted by a particular app or social media.

Now, it would be easy to say ""Just don't use your current phone for entertainment of social media"", and yes, some people might be able to do that, but for the vast majority of users, the Internet and social media continues to suck them in. Just the ABILITY to browse the Internet on your smartphone draws people in and steals hours and hours from them. Apps and the devices themselves are MADE to be addicted - you cannot even argue that that isn't true. We buy and use phones that were predesigned to use up as much of our times as they can in an effort to make more money off of us via ads, etc.

So what I want to ask you: Would it be worth it to buy a phone that DOESN'T steal precious hours of your life from you? How much is that worth to you to **not** have the ability to be distracted and to constantly live in the moment? Just something to think about...

Let's have a civil conversation in the comments about the idea of this device. Does it have the power to change your life or is it a total unnecessary farce.

minimalism,How do you reconcile minimalism with frugality in regards to kid clothes?,"I've been a minimalist for 7 years, although there's always room for improvement. We also try to live a frugal, low-waste lifestyle. I have a 2 year old boy and a 5 month old girl, and I accept hand-me-down clothing from friends. At any given time, I have about 10 boxes of clothes in the next sizes up just sitting in a room until we need them. Whenever I finish with a size, I donate them to another friend or sell them to the consignment store. My son has 2 drawers in his current size, and my daughter has 1 drawer. This isn't really a problem since I have the space to store these boxes of clothes, but I'm curious as to how other minimalists would handle this.

minimalism,Getting Rid of 10 Things/Month - June Update: Boxes,"Following up on [my original promise to get rid of a net 10 things/month](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/abuz4j/2019_promise_getting_rid_of_10_possessionsmonth/) here comes the Junereport.

-	**IN**: 34 things
-	**OUT**: 46things
-	**NET**: -12

Barely made it this month. An large influx of fountain pens (thanks /r/fountainpens) had me scramble to make up for it so I had to reach into a reserve I was saving for a ""drier"" month: **boxes**.

I'm sure I'm not the only one to save the boxes of purchased items. I bet I'm also a bit more compulsive than most for I tend to chuck into the attic the boxes of almost all items I purchased, and to be frank some are ridiculous saves:

- that flat screen I bought 8 years ago and which has been hanging on my wall ever since;
- the box for a vise (yes, one heavy vise) I've used some 10 years ago;
- box and stickers from an Apple 30-pin-to-USB adapter;
- the box the locks for the house came in, long ago installed;
- all the boxes for the parts I used to build a computer: cpu, memory, PSU, graphic card, etc -- all kept.

The list goes on. I'm sure there's a deeper psychological reason, perhaps it's fear of commitment  or permanency or perhaps having moved a few times and seeing that the boxes helped protect the items I decided to keep them even though I haven't moved in 10 years; perhaps it's a hidden hope that I'd be selling some of these items and thus a boxes version would command a higher price (plot twist: never sold a single items); and then there is, of course, the habit formed from keeping the boxes all these years that begets new boxes be kept. 

The exercise was eye-opening and I never realized what I pack-rat I've been till I took multiple trips from the attic to the recycling bin to unload all that I gathered.

[I decided](http://ayearof.xyz/2019/june_report.html) that for the future, every time I’m putting a box in the attic, I’m also putting a post-it note on it with the month it went in, and then periodically re-evaluate the items: for most, if 3 months have passed and the item is seeing good use, there’s no point in keeping the box.

The exercise has also taught me is to evaluate the items I’m buying with a more critical eye towards reselling probability. Realistically, if it’s not a collectible item or if it’s an item whose value drastically decreases over time it does not need its box preserved (a 5-year old iPad won't sell any better -- or at all -- if it's got a box or not).

It also makes me wonder: **if I buying an item and keeping its box, should that count as two**? 
 
If the answer is ""yes"", that completely destroys my accounting for June, so I think I will wait one more day before I decide one way or another.",2019-06-29 21:37:30,12,24

minimalism,Families with kids--how do you manage expectations re: Christmas and birthdays?,"My wife and I have a 3 year old, and we live 5 hours from our home town and families. Both of our families back home are absolutely riddled with consumerism, almost to the point of them being hoarders. Add to that their disdain for us living further away so they don't get to see the kid as often as they'd like, and you can imagine what ""a good Christmas/birthday"" means... Piles upon piles of gifts. We've fought with our families about this ever since our kid was born to reduce the sheer about of stuff they buy for him, and they've acquiesced somewhat. But even after all that, this past Christmas for example, we dropped off practically a full car load of toys, clothes, etc at the Goodwill before heading home. On the one hand I don't want to deprive them the opportunity to show love in their own way. But on the other, it's disgusting how much money is wasted, and how much waste is generated from this bizarre cultural experience. I sort of want to just say ""no more gifts"". At least, no more permanent objects. Food/drink is ok, experiential stuff (tickets, travel, etc) is ok. Time spent with each other is ok. But absolutely no more stuff, and if they get it anyway, it's getting immediately donated. And then I wonder how my kid is going to think/feel about this as he grows up with friends whose families are probably also eaten up with consumerism. Is he going to feel deprived? Unloved? Inadequate?",2019-06-29 19:14:41,22,9
